Since the work of the Dirce and Prado/Fienga Painters has already been studied 

in some detail in PP, LCS and their Supplements; it is here discussed principally for its 

significance in regard to the first phases of Campanian and Paestan red-figure; the 

lists below are not exhaustive, but include what seem to be the most relevant of the 

Sicilian vases in that particular respect, with a few additions and some minor 

regroupings. Chapter III deals with the comparatively small group of vases which 

mark the transition from Sicilian to the mainland fabrics. Most of the vases listed 

below belong to the period between c. 380 and 360 B.C. Bibliographical references 

are generally confined to PP, LCS and their Supplements (where earlier literature is 

cited) and to subsequent publications. 

The Dirce Group consists primarily of the work of the Dirce Painter himself and

of his close follower, the Painter of Naples 2074. Their styles are remarkably alike, 

and it is not always easy to distinguish between them, so that the possibility of the 

latter's work representing what we may call the 'Campanian' phase of the former's 

cannot be altogether excluded. Between the two has been placed a group of 

'transitional' vases; some of these were formerly attributed to the Dirce Painter and 

others to the Painter of Naples 2074, but I now see them as closer in style to the 

former and think they should probably be attributed to his hand. The evidence of 

proveniences is discussed in the Introduction to this chapter; they would seem to 

favour the work of the Painter of Naples 2074 as being early Campanian rather than 

pure Sicilian. 

(i) The Dirce Painter 

The Dirce Painter was first identified by Beazley in a communication to Paul 

Jacobsthal, quoted in Die Melischen Reliefs, p. 83, note 4, where the three vases in 

Syracuse (nos. 1, 7 and 8) and the Dirce krater in Berlin (no. 2) were ascribed to 

him, with the suggestion that the painter was possibly a Sicilian. The characteristic 

features of his style are dealt with in some detail in PP (pp. 7 ff.) and LCS (pp. 202-3) 

and need not be repeated here except to draw particular attention to his use of an 

embattled or dot-stripe border pattern on his drapery and to his repetitions of 

several 'stock figures' like the seated woman, with a piece of drapery over the lower 

part of her body, or the young snub-nosed satyr. The influence of his style of drawing 

and of his decorative pattern-work on Paestan will be discussed in greater detail 

later.

The following vase, formerly in Dorpat and known to me only from the illustration 

in the catalogue of Malmberg and Felsberg (no. 109, pi. 7, 1), looks as if it might also 

be by the Dirce Painter, in view of the similarity of the pattern-work, and the 

treatment of the Greek warrior, but without seeing its reverse I hesitate on a specific 

attribution:

(ii) 

In PP and PPSupp the vases in this division were attributed either to the Dirce 

Painter himself (nos. 18 and 22) or to his followers, and among their works were 

listed many vases which were later (LCS, pp. 213-16; Suppl. Ill, pp. 107-10) placed 

in or near the Prado/Fienga Group. Several of the vases listed below (e.g. nos. 

13-20) were attributed in Suppl. Ill to the Painter of Naples 2074, though it was 

pointed out that his work was extremely close to that of the Dirce Painter. Since then 

a few new vases, which seem certainly to be by the former's hand (nos. 24�6), have 

come to light and these enable us now to draw a better distinction between the work 

of the two painters, though without excluding the possibility that they are identical. 

I should now incline to see the vases in this division as the work of the Dirce Painter, 

and as marking the transition from what we may call his 'Sicilian' style to that of his 

later vases, which may well have been made in Campania. 

There are many points of close resemblance between the vases in this and in the 

preceding division, as may be seen from a comparison between the seated women 

with a dot-stripe bordered cloak over their legs (cf. nos. 3-5, 7-8 (reverses), 9-10 

with nos. 13, 18-22), the standing draped woman with a himation over her tunic 

(cf. nos. 3-4, reverse of 5, with the reverses of nos. 13-15), or simply wearing a peplos 

(cf. nos. 5) (reverse to r.), 7 (reverse to 1.) with nos. 13 (reverse to 1.), 15-16 (reverses 

to 1.), 17 (reverse to r.) and 18); the adjuncts and filling ornaments (e.g. the trees on 

nos. 2, 4, 7, 15; the fillets held by the women on nos. 3 (reverse), 5 (reverse), 10 

(reverse), 13-14 (reverses), 16 (reverse) and 22; the thyrsus heads with their A 

pattern and white dots; the dish with reverse wave decoration on nos. 8, 13 and 22; 

the palmette-scrolls on nos. 1 (reverse), 8, 13; the pattern-work, which very 

frequently consists of meanders with saltire squares. 

There are, however, certain points of difference�on the kraters in this division 

only sal tires accompany the meanders, which on nos. 14, 17-19 are stopt; all the 

reverses show static scenes; a white stephane with small rays comes into fashion for 

women (e.g. nos. 13, 14, 16-19, 22) in contrast to the plain bandeau preferred in (i); 

naked or half-draped women make a more frequent appearance, with rounded 

breasts and clearly defined nipples (e.g. nos. 14 and 17). The mythological subjects, 

which added to the interest of the vases in (i), disappear almost completely except on 

no. 15, which seems best placed here in view of the similarity between its reverse and 

those of nos. 13 and 14, though on them the drawing is more precise. In general, 

women tend to have rather small mouths, with lips fairly tightly compressed (e.g. 

nos. 13-14, 16, 18, 22). Greater use is also made of added white to indicate rising 

ground (nos. 14�19). On the whole, however, the differences seem less significant 

than the similarities, and could well be accounted for by the normal developments 

taking place in the painter's style.

(iii) The Painter of Naples 2074 

Although the vases in this division have much in common with those in the two 

preceding ones, there are some significant points of difference, especially in the 

drapery of the women and in the pattern-work on the bell-kraters. The side-scrolls 

springing out from the fan-palmettes below the handles now assume a more definite 

form (Fig. 3, I above), which reappears with some modifications on the vases in the 

Group of Louvre K240; a large palmette leaf rises up from the base of the fan to curl 

inwards at the handle-join, with a spiral scroll about two-thirds the way up the stem, 

above which is a diamond floral, a flower (on the obverse of no. 25), or a single leaf, 

and below a half palmette-fan (cf. nos. 23-6). This represents a slight modification of 

the patterns on the bell-kraters by the Dirce Painter, in which the leaf on the side-

scroll is of a more sickle-like shape. Further, all four bell-kraters have a band of stopt 

meanders below the pictures, without saltire or chequered squares. A white-studded 

girdle comes into more general use with the peplos (e.g. on nos. 23-6, 28, 31-32). It 

is interesting to compare the youths on the reverse of no. 23 with those on nos. 4 and 

6, where the stance is very different, as is the actual draping of the himatia. The 

continued use of the dot-stripe border, the treatment of the young satyr, the presence 

of the seated draped woman, and the peplos with the rather stiff-looking overfall, 

however, all indicate the close association with the work of the Dirce Painter. 

Originally two other bell-kraters, Louvre K241 and S. Agata 66, were 

associated with the Painter of Naples 2074, but these have now been transferred to 

the Group of Louvre K 240, which seems to follow on almost directly from this 

painter's work and to mark the transition to the true Paestan style. They are dealt 

with in Chapter III.

attribution. The seated figure on the obverse is, however, close to the corresponding 

one on no. 25 and the florals are similar to those on the obverse of that vase.

(a) Amazonomachy�two Greek warriors and a mounted Amazon, [b) woman, holding

This vase, of particular interest for its Albanian provenience, is connected, bo

by its pattern-work and its treatment of the two subjects represented, with the works 

of the painters listed in divisions (i) and (ii) above. The picture on the obverse is 

framed between bands of chevron-pattern (cf. the Kropatschek oenochoe, no. 40 

below; also the early Paestan neck-amphora, Geneva HR 26 = no. 2/1), and on the 

reverse the scrolls flanking the picture have a diamond-shaped floral above a spiral, 

like those on nos. 23-6 above. The saltire squares which accompany the meanders 

find many parallels on other vases in the Dirce Group, and the small tree on the 

obverse is comparable to those on nos. 2, 3, and 7. The treatment of the reverse, and 

especially of the seated woman with the mirror, recalls nos. 5, 8 (reverse), 16, 20 and 

22, and we may also note the wave-pattern on the inner rim of the shield, as on nos. 7 

and 13. It is difficult to determine whether the vase is an import or a local imitation; 

if the former, it would have been more likely to come from Campania, like the pelike 

by the Eros and Hare Painter (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 104, no. 100), and this may well 

have been the case, since the neck-amphora is a popular shape in that fabric and 

some at least of the vases by the Painter of Naples 2074 must have been made there.

Dr. Marie-Louise Bernhard in the text to the CVA (p. 17) assigns this vase to the fabric of 
Paestum; it certainly has stylistic affinities with some of the earlier vases in Chapter IV, but 
seems better placed here, since the floral is closer to those on nos. 25 and 33; the palmette 
scroll also finds a parallel on no. 36, as does the young satyr. 

Painters (LCS, pp. 212-15; Suppl. I, p. 40; II, p. 135; III, pp. 107-10), who were 

merely included with the followers of the Dirce Painter in PP and PPSupp, but 

separately identified in LCS, should be united as a single painter. The stylistic 

connection between the vases previously attributed to the two painters is so close, 

especially in regard to the figures on the reverses, that they must be the work of the 

same hand. As with the vases of the Dirce Group, the proveniences are mixed; of 

those by the Prado/Fienga Painter himself nine certainly come from Sicily and, while 

none has an established Campanian provenience, it is likely that at least four (nos. 

42, 50, 51 and 53) come from that area. Of the vases in the Group of Louvre K 236, 

none has a Sicilian provenience, two were found in Locri, one in Nola, and one (no. 

69) is said to come from Viterbo. It looks again as if at least one of the painters in this 

Group�probably the Painter of Louvre K 236�established a workshop in Cam 

pania, since his work had a very strong influence upon early Campanian and also on 

Paestan; other artists may well have remained in Sicily since the larger vases 

associated with the Lentini-Manfria Group, like those by the Painter of the Lugano 

Pyxis, and in the Adrastos, Maron and Gibil Gabib Groups (LCS, Suppl. Ill, pp. 

273-7) also reflect the influence of the Prado/Fienga Group. One point is worth 

making here, that on the vases of the Sicilian followers we seldom find dot-stripe 

borders to the drapery, while in Campania and especially at Paestum they are in 

regular use. 

(i) The Prado/Fienga Painter 

The chief stylistic characteristics of this painter are set out in LCS, p. 214, but we 

may note, in particular, that: 

(a) the composition of the main pictures is more elaborate, often with four or 

five figures disposed on different levels, sometimes in active movement; the reverses 

regularly represent two draped figures, usually wrapped in a himation, at first with a 

plain border, later with a dot-stripe. Youths usually wear a white head-band or 

chaplet, women a saccos or a white radiate stephane. 

(b) the faces tend to look rather heavier, especially the chin, which is very 

strongly emphasised on the later vases and those associated with Louvre K 236. 

(c) kraters regularly have chequers or crossed squares with the meanders; the 

squares generally have a saltire cross, either with a large solid black triangle in the 

four divisions (e.g. nos. 42, 45-7), or two hollow triangles, one inside the other (nos. 

43^1, 48); on some vases (nos. 49, 50, 58) the meander assumes a flatter, rectangular 

form, which is highly individual; wave-pattern is used on the bell-kraters nos. 51 and 

53. 

(d) a new type of floral appears on the side-scrolls, consisting of a saucer-shaped 

flower with a large cluster of dots in the centre (e.g. on nos. 50-1, 53, 55-7). 

(e)'there is a marked preference for Dionysiac subjects, nearly all the vases 

depicting maenads and satyrs, but not the god himself; thyrsi, tambourines, panther-

skins and ivy wreaths appear with great frequency.

The bell-krater no. 48 serves as an excellent link between these two divisions 

painter's work. The dotted flower accompanying the side-palmettes is similar to 

those on nos. 46-7 (cf. also the crescent-shaped leaf, which is like those on nos. 8 and 

10 above); the lightly-sprung palmette leaves below it are repeated on nos. 49 and 

51. The figures on the obverse are neatly drawn and comparable to those on Lipari 

6814 (no. 46); the tambourine in the top right corner of the obverse of no. 49 finds a 

parallel in those on the reverse of the Fienga krater (no. 50) and on nos. 52 and 58.

The vases in this sub-division, while almost certainly the work of the painter himself, 

lead on to those in the Group of Louvre K 236. 

The skyphoid pyxis in Ragusa (no. 58) provides a good connecting link and is of 

particular interest, both for its shape and for its decoration. The two skyphoid 

pyxides (nos. 55-6) in sub-division (b) are similar in shape, but have figured scenes 

on the lid, as against an extremely well-drawn vine-wreath, with pendant bunches of 

black grapes on no. 58. Here the side palmettes are also more elaborate, and the rims 

of both the bowl and the lid are decorated with egg-pattern instead of dicing (double 

rows of dots). However, the characteristic flat rectangular meanders (cf. nos. 49-50) 

and the no less typical tambourine (cf. nos. 49, 50, 52) and kalathos (cf. nos. 45, 47), 

as well as the rendering of the drapery and the drawing of the bearded silen show the 

vase to be by the painter's own hand. We should, however, note that on the vases 

below the pupil of the eye tends to be rather larger and the chin a little heavier. 

The bell-like flowers which flank the fan-palmette below the handles find an 

interesting parallel on a mosaic from Eretria, which has been dated in the first third 

of the fourth century B.C. They reappear in a slightly different form on Syracuse 

47039 and the Lugano skyphoid pyxis (see Trendall, NAC9, 1980, p. 98 and fig. 4 A). 

The side-scrolls with palmette-fans above and below the spirals look forward to Type 

III of Early Paestan.

(ii) The Painter of Louvre K236 

As was pointed out in LCS (p. 216), there is very little to distinguish this painter from 

the Prado/Fienga Painter. However, the appearance of some new vases by his hand, 

especially the Geddes krater (no. 63) and the transference to him of Hope 260 (now 

Canberra 83.01) enable us to see his work in somewhat greater detail than was 

previously possible and to define more clearly some of the ways in which it diverges 

from that of the Prado/Fienga Painter. It is also worth noting that, while two of the 

vases (nos. 65 and 67) come from Locri, none has a definite Sicilian provenience, and 

one (no. 68) is known to have been found in Nola; it is also probable that the vases 

formerly in the Hope and Palagi collections (nos. 64, 70-1) came from Campania 

rather than from further south. 

Louvre K236 and the Geddes krater go very closely together in shape, 

composition, style and pattern-work and provide an excellent basis for the study of 

this painter's work. Both their obverses have four-figure compositions, each with two 

Ducrey and Metzger, Ant.Welt 10.1, 1979, p. 4, fig. 4; AntK22, 1979, pi. 1,2 and pi. 2,4. 

groups of two figures, one of which is a seated woman, with the usual dot-stripe 

bordered drapery over her legs; the second figure in each group varies, a woman 

bending forward over her raised right foot, or standing with one arm akimbo and a 

tambourine held up in her right hand, an Eros with a phiale, a bearded silen 

bending forward with an ivy-branch in his right hand. The two reverses are very 

similar, on no. 62 a woman with a himation over her tunic, falling down over her left 

shoulder and passing under her right arm, which is stretched out, a white egg held in 

the palm of her hand, faces a woman draped in much the same manner, except for 

her himation which runs transversely across her body, and holding out a phiale in 

her right hand; on the other vase (no. 63) the figure to left is a youth, but otherwise 

the scene is much the same, with a palmette scroll between the two figures and a 

phiale in the field above. The draping of the himation of the left-hand figure, over 

the shoulder with the visible edges meeting at a right-angle (cf. with no. 54 by the 

Prado/Fienga Painter), and the 'tail-like' fall of the lower corner of the himation of 

the one on the right seem typical of this painter. The boldly-drawn, clear fold-lines of 

the women's drapery, especially across the chest and over the legs, are also 

characteristic and differ slightly from those on the drapery of the Prado/Fienga 

Painter. The white-studded girdle is also popular, as is a dotted kekryphalos or saccos 

with a radiate stephane. The presence of a tambourine, decked with white ribbons, 

and having a white cross or dotted circle on a black disk in the centre is also very 

common (cf. nos. 62-4, 68, 70-2). 

The Louvre and Geddes kraters enable us to attribute the calyx-krater recently 

acquired by the Classics Department of the Australian National University in 

Canberra (83.01; no. 64) to the same hand. This vase, formerly in the Hope 

collection (Tillyard, no. 260), was at first placed with the followers of the Dirce 

Painter (PP, no. 9) and then (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 100) grouped with Lipari 168 F (no. 

13 above), on the strength of the resemblance of the draped woman on the reverse to 

the corresponding one on that vase. The resemblance is indeed very close, but it is 

still closer to the two on the reverses of nos. 62-3, and the youth finds a better 

parallel in the one on no. 63, especially in the overhang of his himation and the 

rendering of the fold-lines. If we turn to the obverse we will again note the strong 

fold-lines on the drapery of the two women, as well as the characteristic head-dress 

and tambourine. More significant, perhaps, is the drawing of the pupil of their eyes 

as a large black dot, which is more characteristic of this group than of the vases 

associated with the Dirce Painter. The bearded silen with the white ivy-branch is 

also very close to his counterpart on the Geddes krater. The other vases attributed to 

this painter, especially the Louvre skyphos (no. 68), merely repeat figures from the 

larger vases; nos. 70-2 form a very compact group, and it is interesting to note that 

on the three oenochoai (nos. 71-3) the pictures are all framed between reserved 

bands decorated with chevrons or ivy. 

The Painter of Louvre K 236 is of particular importance for his relationship to 

the Painter of the Geneva Orestes in Early Paestan.

(iii) Vases related in style 

The three vases in this division were all considered in LCS and Suppl. Ill as b

associated with the Prado/Fienga Painter and this seems to be the case, although 

they stand slightly apart from the vases specifically attributed to his hand. All are 

connected by the presence of a seated figure across the lower part of whose body is a 

piece of drapery with a wave-pattern border and embroidered dot-clusters. The bold 

fold-lines, very clear on the drapery of Aphrodite on the Cefalu lebes (no. 75) or of 

the canephoros on the Naples amphora (no. 76), are in the typical manner of the 

Prado/Fienga Painter, as is the bearded silen on the lost vase published by Tischbein 

(no. 74). There can be little doubt that it is in the present context that all three vases 

should find a place. The subjects depicted on nos. 75-6 represent a departure from 

the normal themes on vases by the Prado/Fienga Painter, though Eros appears not 

infrequently in his work (e.g. on nos. 45, 50, 51, 58-9, 62), but the mythological 

scenes on both sides of no. 76 hark back to the Dirce Painter. As yet no very 

convincing interpretation of either has been put forward. The scene on the obverse 

shows a woman, seated in an attitude of dejection, on the stepped basis of an Ionic 

tomb-monument, the shaft of which she grasps with her upraised left hand; to left 

stands a woman with a basket of offerings on her head, a wreath in one hand and an 

alabastron in the other; to right, a white-haired woman, perhaps the old nurse, leans 

forward over her right foot which rests on the top step. The scene, which from the 

gestures and the offerings, must be one of mourning, may be little more than generic, 

though it has much in common with representations of Electra at the tomb of 

Agamemnon, and it may perhaps represent the moment before the arrival of Orestes 

and Pylades, who appear on the Geneva amphora (no. 2/1 below). The reverse 

shows a bearded man, with a stick in his right hand and a phiale in his left, standing 

in front of a woman seated on an altar (or stele) and holding a sceptre in her right 

hand. It distantly reminds me of Aigeus and Themis on Berlin F2538, but on the 

amphora the attributes are reversed, since it is the man who holds the phiale and the 

woman the sceptre.

3. THE SIKON AND TUNNY-SELLER PAINTERS 

The work of these two painters is linked by the similarity of the patter

especially the florals, which flanks the pictures on their bell-kraters. They belong to 

the borderland between Sicilian, Campanian and Paestan and well illustrate the 

effects of a common Sicilian background upon the two latter fabrics. This is 

particularly clear in the reverses, as may be seen by comparing the reverse of the 

Dublin krater by the Sikon Painter with that of the Orestes amphora in Geneva (no. 

2/1 below), which is early Paestan, or the reverses of the two kraters by the Tunny-

seller Painter with those on the earlier Paestan vases from the Asteas-Python 

workshop. 

(i) The Sikon Painter 

The Sikon Painter was identified in LCS (p. 213) where he was rightly placed near 

the Prado/Fienga Painter. He is probably an early Campanian artist, but should be 

considered here for the parallels to early Paestan which his vases afford us. Perhaps 

the most remarkable feature of his kraters is his practice of framing the pictures on 

their obverses between vertical reserved bands decorated with wave-pattern and 

with a band of egg-pattern across the top on nos. 77-8 and 80, and a row of dentils 

on no. 79, perhaps intended to convey the suggestion of a building of which the 

vertical 'posts' support, as it were, an architrave. This dentil pattern, in a slightly 

simpler form with black alternating with reserved areas, occurs quite frequently on 

later Sicilian vases, usually just below the pictures, where it sometimes gives the 

effect of a stage-floor supported by posts; it reappears in Paestan on the Cadmus and 

Opheltes kraters by Python (nos. 2/241-2 below). The reverses show very clearly the 

strong influence of the Prado/Fienga Group in both the composition and the 

treatment of the drapery; the floral patterns recall those of nos. 48-9 above. They 

also seem to have inspired some of those on early Campanian vases in the Cassandra 

and Parrish Groups. 

The phlyax actor on the former Ruesch krater (no. 77) is inscribed ZIKQN, 

which at least suggests a Sicilian connection, and his costume should be compared 

with that of the phylakes on nos. 99-101 and 105 in Chapter III.

So far only two vases, both bell-kraters, can be assigned to this painter, and of 

these one (no. 83) has vanished from sight and is known to me only from the 

illustrations in the Sale Catalogue. There can be little doubt, however, that the two 

vases go closely together�they are almost identical in shape and pattern-work, with 

florals very similar to those on nos. 79-80 above; the wave-pattern below the 

pictures, already noted on no. 80 is to become standard on Paestan bell-kraters and 

the two youths on the reverses also show affinities with those of that fabric. 

The scene on no. 82 has been the subject of much discussion; it finds an 

interesting parallel on a Lucanian bell-krater by the Brooklyn-Budapest Painter in a 

private collection in Munich (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 69, no. BB 32, where bibliography), 

and the rendering of the two fish recalls that on some of the early Sicilian fish-plates 

(cf. Claude Bjork in Medelhavsmuseet Bulletin 19, 1984, pp. 63 ff, figs. 2-A and 7-9), 

which are discussed in detail in Greek Red-figured Fish-plates (pp. 59-67). 

On the present evidence it is very difficult to determine where these two vases 

were made, even though one of them has an assured Sicilian provenience. They are 

related to Sicilian, Campanian and Paestan, and should certainly find a place in any 

study of the background to the two latter fabrics. In view of their connections with 

the work of the Sikon Painter, I should at present incline to think of them as more 

likely to be Campanian. 

The Eros and Hare and Revel Painters have not been discussed in this chapter 

since both seem Campanian and, while they reflect the influences of some of the 

painters discussed above, they have less connection with the origins of Paestan. 

We have now passed in review some 80 vases which fall, on broad stylistic 

principles, into two fairly homogeneous groups, capable of further sub-division 

according to the individual characteristics of the various artists represented. A 

substantial proportion of these vases has an assured Sicilian provenience and they 

must be regarded as of local manufacture. Others come from various sites in 

Calabria and Campania, and one at least from Paestum (no. 26), and this suggests a 

possible migration of artists from Sicily to those areas, either in transit or to take up 

permanent abode. In any case the groups of vases we have just considered provide 

the background against which the local fabrics of Campania and Paestum came into 

existence during the second quarter of the fourth century B.C. and flourished there 

during the rest of that century, each developing its own particular characteristics 

with the progress of time, but never entirely losing sight of their original source of 

inspiration. Pottery continued to be made in Sicily, and it is interesting to compare 

those vases produced locally by followers of the Dirce and Prado/Fienga Painters, 

like the Painter of the Agrigento Pyxis (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 112), in the period 

between c. 370 and 360 B.C., when the mainland fabrics come into being, or by the 

slightly later artists, like the Painter of the Lugano Pyxis or those associated with the 

Adrastos, Maron and Gibil Gabib Groups (op. cit., pp. 274�7), with those after 

c. 340 B.C., when a substantial revival of the Sicilian pottery industry took place 

following the victories of Timoleon. Many significant differences between Sicilian 

after c. 360 B.C. and Paestan may be observed, both in the choice and treatment of 

shapes (e.g. the calyx-krater and the skyphoid pyxis) and in the pattern-work and 

the rendering of the drapery (plain black borders rather than dot-stripe; the 

continuing use of the white-studded girdle), as well as in the subject-matter where 

themes with a theatrical association (both tragic and comic) appear on a higher 

proportion of the vases. 

As has already been pointed out, it was the second generation of Sicilian vase-

painters whose work provided the models for early Campanian and Paestan, with 

the result that these two fabrics reflect the influence of Attic to a much lesser extent 

than do Lucanian and Apulian, which had begun half a century earlier, before the 

substantial decline in Attic imports which was one of the consequences of the 

Peloponnesian War. Paestan, perhaps more than Campanian, remained faithful to 

the traditions it had inherited from Sicilian, in shapes, subject-matter, composition 

and pattern-work. 

The preceding chapter listed a number of vases, many of which were found in Sic

and had probably been made there. These vases provide the background, in regard 

to shape, decorative patterns and subject-matter, to the rise and development of the 

red-figure fabrics of Campania and Paestum. It seems highly likely that at least some 

of the vases there discussed were actually made in Campania; in any case they lead 

directly into the earliest schools of Campanian red-figure, the products of which run 

at first along lines closely parallel to those of early Paestan. The present chapter deals 

with the main groups of vases, also of probable Sicilian origin, which seem to lead 

directly to Paestan; indeed, several of them (nos. 85-7, 94�5, 98-100, 102-3) had 

already been assigned to that fabric in PP, PPSupp and PAdd. 

This artist was identified in LCS, pp. 216-7, where nos. 84, 86 and 87 were asc

to his hand; in PPSupp, nos. 85-7 had already been grouped with Early Paestan and 

placed in the section devoted to the 'Followers of the Dirce Painter'. That the four 

vases (nos. 84�7) listed below are the work of a single painter seems almost certain 

from various repeated features which link them all together. Among these we may 

note: 

(i) the woman wearing a peplos, with beaded girdle at the waist, double vertical 

stripe down the centre, and dot-stripe border either to the peplos or the overfall, or 

to both (nos. 84, 86-7); 

(ii) the draped youths to the left on the reverses of nos. 85 and 86; they are 

almost identical, with the same stance, the same overhang of the himation on the 

right shoulder, and the same dot-stripe border; note also the presence of small hook 

like marks on the himatia of both youths; these appear again on the drapery of the 

youths on the reverse of no. 84 which also has dot-stripe borders; 

(iii) the repetition of a small palmette scroll, with a diamond floral, and an 

inward-curving palmette-leaf below the spiral. This is seen to right of the obverse on 

no. 84, below the handles on no. 85, to left of the obverse of no. 86, and upside-down 

on the top left of the obverse of no. 87. On nos. 85-6 the meanders, which are stopt, 

are accompanied by saltire squares with solid black triangles in the intersections, on 

no. 84 with hollow triangles instead. 

As we shall see, the draped youths on nos. 85 and 86 have close affinities with 

those on early Paestan, where also parallels to the running women on nos. 87 and 88 

will be found; the beaded bandeau worn by the woman on no. 87 is also common in 

Paestan. 

The obverse of Syracuse 51282 (no. 85) has been extensively restored and a 

good deal of the figure of Dionysos has been repainted.

The two following vases are comparable in style to the work of the Scoglitti 

Painter, but hardly seem to be by his own hand. In LCS, Suppl. Ill (p. 196) the bell-

krater in Ragusa was associated with Vienna 687 (LCS, pp. 211-2, pi. 83, 3), on the 

strength of the similarity between the fan-palmettes below the handles and their 

side-scrolls with dotted flowers; there is indeed a good deal of resemblance, but it is 

probably little more than generic, and the drawing of the two women on the obverse, 

as well as that of the two figures on the reverse, and especially of their drapery, with 

its dot-stripe borders, looks to be nearer to the work of the Scoglitti Painter.

This is a most interesting and important group of vases which provides a direct

between Sicilian and the first truly Paestan vases from the workshop of Asteas.

Many of the vases have subjects with theatrical associations, depicting comic masks 

in a Dionysiac context or else scenes with phlyax actors. Similar masks appear on 

several Paestan vases either by Asteas himself or from his workshop, as also do the 

female busts looking down from a window, as on Lipari 927 (no. 99), and vases with 

scenes from phlyax plays or showing a single actor, often with Dionysos, are not only 

common in the Asteas-Python workshop but amongst the best and liveliest of all its 

products. It would appear that the vases of this group served as their models. It 

should be noted that four of the vases in it were found at Lipari (nos. 90-92 and 99) 

'See my article in NAC 9, 1980, pp. 112-13. 

where the theatre seems to have played an unusually important part in daily life, as 

well as in art, to judge from the great number of terracotta figurines from that site, 

depicting a variety of characters from Greek drama, some from tragedy but mostly 

from comedy. These are discussed in some detail and well illustrated in Bernabo 

Brea's Menandro e il teatro greco nelle terrecotte liparesi, though the dates there giv

many of the r.f. vases seem to me to be rather later than their style would indicate 

(see LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 268). Of the other vases in this group, two of those with 

known proveniences come from Sicily (no. 102 from Gela and 103 from Syracuse); of 

the next, two come from mainland sites (no. 95 from S. Agata and no. 100 from 

Taranto), and this is also probably true of nos. 94, 96 and 98. It is, therefore, very 

difficult to determine whether these vases were made in Sicily and exported to the 

mainland, or actually made there. In the light of the new evidence from Lipari, it is 

not unreasonable to think that nos. 90-93 are of Sicilian origin, and probably nos. 

99, 102 and 103 also, but it would not surprise me if some at least of the others 

(especially nos. 94-5 and 98) were of mainland manufacture, especially as several 

undoubtedly Paestan vases come from S. Agata. It is perhaps safest, in view of the 

gaps in our knowledge, to regard all these vases as the immediate antecedents of 

Paestan, rather than as true Paestan, although in PP and PPSupp some of them (e.g. 

nos. 94-5, 98-100, 102-3) were in fact so classed. 

(i) Forerunner 

We may begin with a vase recently found in Lipari which provides a connecting link 

between some of the vases of Sicilian origin discussed in Chapter II and those in 

division (ii) below. 

Calyx-krater 

*90 Lipari 11807, from T. 1675 A. Ht. 40-5, diam. 41-9. PLATE 10 c, d 
MTL, p. 267, fig. 444. 
(a) Maenad and Dionysos, who holds a lyre and thyrsus, young satyr fluting, maenad 
with branch, [b) bearded silen with thyrsus pursuing maenad with thyrsus and tambourine. 

In shape this calyx-krater is close to Madrid 32653 by the Prado/Fienga Painter 

(no. 42); the stem is comparatively tall and about a third of the way up from the foot 

is decorated with a reserved stripe above a black band in relief; it runs into the foot in 

a sweeping curve (cf. also no. 45), unlike most of the other calyx-kraters (e.g. nos. 44, 

62^) where the foot is lighter and comparatively flat and the relief band joins it to 

the stem. The chequer pattern accompanying the meanders is also common on vases 

of the Prado/Fienga Group (e.g. nos. 42-5, 62-3), as are the small white plants and 

dot-clusters beside the white ground-lines (e.g. nos. 44�5, 48-9, 62-3). The ivy-

wreaths worn by all the figures on this vase, and the ivy branch carried by the 

maenad to left on the obverse, find good parallels on nos. 45, 50, 54, 56, 63^-, the 

swirling drapery of the three maenads, on nos. 47-8 and especially on nos. 77-8 by 

the Sikon Painter, and the bearded satyr is very similar to those which appear 

frequently on the vases in that group. The connection, therefore, with the vases in 

the Prado/Fienga Group seems fairly clear, and it is no less so with those in division 

(ii), where again we shall find the white ground-line with dot-clusters and small 

E.g. two vases signed by Asteas (Naples 3226 and Berlin F3044); one by Python, B.M. F 14

(B.M. F154). 

plants (nos. 91, 98), the ivy-wreaths and branches (nos. 91, 93, 95, 98), the swirling 

drapery (nos. 95-8), the running maenad with the overfall bordered by a dot-stripe 

(reverses of nos. 95-7). 

(ii) The Painter of Louvre K240 

The Painter of Louvre K 240 is an artist of considerable interest and importance, 

whose work marks the transition from Sicilian to Paestan and leads directly on to 

that of Asteas. It falls into two groups, one containing vases with Dionysiac or 

related scenes, the other with representations of phlyakes. 

(a)

phlyax mask (B), bending forward in front of seated Dionysos, with drapery over his lower 
limbs, holding a kantharos in his r. hand and a thyrsus, with suspended bell at top, in his 1.; 
beside him is a table with four eggs on it, and behind him a maenad, wearing a loin-cloth, and 
holding an egg in her outstretched r. hand and a flute in her 1., slightly above to r. is a seated 
bearded silen with phiale in 1. and egg in r. Above in the centre hangs a white female mask 
(SS), and to r. an ivy trail; below to 1. a calyx-krater, [b) draped woman, holding thyrsus in 1., 
standing in front of young satyr bending forward with an open wreath held in both hands, 
between them, a small palmette. 

*92 Lipari 9558, from T. 921. Ht. 38-5. PLATE 11 c, d 
MTL, fig. 442. 
(a) Bearded silen approaching sleeping maenad between to 1., Pan with raised hands in a 
gesture of surprise, and to r. papposilen shading his eyes (6:ITOCTKOTTEUCOV); above to r., bust of 
maenad with outflung arms; below, small palmette and pointed amphora on its side, [b) nude 
youth with wreath in r. hand, stick and wreath in 1., draped woman with fillet and 
tambourine. 

These two vases almost form a matching pair in shape and decoration. Here the 

stem is shorter than on no. 90; the relief band, with a reserved stripe on either side of 

it, is placed where the stem joins the foot; the handle-zone again decorated with stopt 

meanders and a chequered square. Of particular interest are the two comic masks, 

one of the slave (type B � OMC, p. 15), the other, suspended above, probably that 

of the young woman (type SS = OMC, p. 22), which reappears on Lipari 927 

(no. 99) and on vases by Asteas (cf. also the masks on Louvre K240). A further 

connection with the work of Asteas is to be seen in the figure of Dionysos (cf. also 

Lipari 927); the treatment of the face and the head, with an ivy-wreath around it 

and an intertwined red fillet, decorated with white dots, which falls down onto his 

shoulders is very much in the manner of Asteas, as is also the drapery, with its dot-

stripe border and embroidered stars or circles. Comparable heads will also be seen 

on nos. 94�5, 100-101, as well as on several early Paestan vases (e.g. nos. 2/8-9, 

24�6). The reverse, however, with the satyr bending forward beisde a standing 

maenad, finds better parallels in Sicilian, especially on the reverses of Syracuse 

47039 and the calyx-krater from Selinunte (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 274, nos. 46 and 46 a). 

The second krater (no. 92) shows a silen coming up to a sleeping woman, her r. 

hand flung up around her head in the typical way in which sleepers are depicted in 

Greek art (see P. J. Connor in AA, 1984, pp. 387-94); she is not Ariadne, but a 

maenad, since she wears a fawn-skin and rests against a tambourine. The half-length 

maenad who appears with outstretched arms, as if looking down on the scene partly 

concealed by rising round, is destined to become a popular figure in Paestan; note 

also the rows of white buttons down the short sleeves of her chiton, since they also 

will reappear frequently. The white-haired and bearded silen, wearing a red head 

band, links this vase with nos. 94 and 95, as also does the white ivy-wreath above the 

picture. Here the figures on the reverse are static, a standing youth with a wreath in 

each hand and a tall stick in the left, a draped woman, wearing peplos with overfall, 

but without dot-stripe borders, holding a looped fillet in one hand and a tambourine 

in the other; down the centre of her peplos runs a double black stripe, a decorative 

element which we shall see frequently in Paestan. 

A few fragments, probably also from a calyx-krater, found in the Lipari 

necropolis (Tr. xxxv, sporadic) look to be connected in style with the above:

Louvre K240 (no. 94) provides a good connecting link with the two calyx-

kraters (nos. 91-2), repeating several of the features (comic mask, white-haired silen, 

suspended ivy-wreath, etc.) that we had noted on them. Here, however, the masks 

look to be those of the hetaira (XA, with side hair; XB, with hair enclosed = OMC, 

p. 24). The double dot-stripe running down the chiton of the fluting maenad, and 

the beaded head-band of the standing woman on the reverse are both very much in 

the Paestan fashion. The side-scrolls springing out from the base of the palmette-fan 

below the handles are in general form like those of Type I, but now a single drop-leaf 

takes the place of the small fan beneath the spiral on the stem (Type II; as also on 

nos. 95, 97 and 98) and there is a diamond floral above it. The running maenads 

with profile heads and almost frontal bodies on the reverses of nos. 95 and 98 should 

be compared with the corresponding figure on no. 90. All wear a peplos with a dot-

stripe border to the overfall and lower hem, and a white-beaded girdle. Nos. 96 and 

97 go closely together in the treatment of their obverses; the youth with the lyre finds 

a counterpart in Dionysos on no. 90. The Eros on the back of the papposilen on 

Louvre K 241 reappears on the phlyax krater no. 101; the little bell on the thyrsus of 

Dionysos on no. 97 is also found on no. 98 and again on an early Paestan bell-krater 

in Melbourne (no. 2/24). The reverse is of more than usual interest for this painter� 

it shows a nude youth between a half-draped youth (type Bv) and a draped youth 

(type A2 r, holding wreath); it is extremely close to early Paestan in its treatment of 

the two draped youths, and gives one pause to reflect whether the transition to that 

fabric has not now been made. The work of the Painter of Louvre K240 follows a 

very coherent pattern, extremely like that found on the early vases from the 

workshop of Asteas. 
(*) 

The vases in this sub-division all represent scenes associated with the phlyax plays. 

Most of them are already very well-known and have been widely published and do 

not in consequence require treatment in very great detail.

White-haired phlyax (mask L) with crooked stick, part of another figure. 

The phlyakes on these vases fall into two types�that of the old man, with white 

hair and beard (Type L = OMC, p. 18), who appears on all six, and that of the 

slave (Type B = OMC, p. 15), who appears on nos. 94 and 103. The typical phlyax 

costume consists of a slightly padded jerkin, usually painted red on Paestan vases, 

with patches in a lighter shade of pink for the area around the nipples and the navel, 

and tightly-fitting hose on arms and legs. It might be compared to a suit of tights, to 

which a large phallus has been attached, and in this form simulates the appearance 

of nudity. Over it may be worn a short chiton, usually painted white, and sometimes 

a chlamys over that. The stripe that runs down the legs on the hose worn by the two 

phlyakes on no. 99, to mark the seam, is of interest, since it is particularly 

characteristic of Paestan phlyax costumes, where it generally appears in added 

white. On the same vase, the scene is depicted as taking place on a stage, beneath 

the wooden floor of which is a row of white dots, representing the ends of the cross 

beams, and it is supported by a number of posts concealed behind a long curtain-like 

piece of drapery, which has been pinned on to them. The stage setting here 

anticipates that on the phlyax krater in Berlin (F3044; no. 2/125 below) signed by 

Asteas, for which it may well have been the model. 

It will be noted that on the three calyx-kraters (nos. 99-101) Dionysos is also 

present, looking very much as he does on nos. 91 and 95, and that on no. 99 there are 

two figures wearing comic female masks (Type XB and S) looking down from 

windows on the scene taking place below. The picture is framed, in a manner very 

typical of Paestan, by reserved bands with small white capitals at the top to give the 

effect of columns and to emphasise the theatrical setting. The running maenad on 

the reverse should be compared with those on nos. 90, 95-97; for the dotted nipple of 

the silen cf. Canberra 83.01 by the Painter of Louvre K236 (no. 64). The Taranto 

E.g. nos. 2/19, 26, 33, 45, 64, 125, 176-7, 223, 238, 258, 278, 306. Several others have a black line 

to mark the seam. 

The white stripe appears also on the calyx-krater Glasgow 03.70f from Lipari [PhV, no. 78), but 

this is Sicilian. A row of white dots (cf. Gela 8255; no. 102) runs down the leg of the phlyax on the 

fragmentary oenochoe Taranto 4658 [PhV, no. 119; CVA 1, IV Dr, pi. 15,2); this is exceptional. 

krater (no. 100) is close in style, but is ill preserved; the ecstatic maenad is close to the 

one on Louvre K241 (no. 98), the sedate draped woman on the reverse to those on 

nos. 91 and 94. 

The calyx-krater (no. 101) on the New York market strikes a rather different 

note. On the obverse we see the typical Dionysos, a lyre in one hand (cf. nos. 90, 

96-7) and the plectrum in the other, moving rapidly to left over gently undulating 

ground, from which spring up some small plants and flowers; he is followed by an old 

phlyax, waving a flaming torch in each hand, and by a bearded silen, doing his best 

to play the flute, while he carries a small Eros, 'flying angel' on his back (cf. no. 98). 

It is a lively scene, with contrasting expressions on the faces of the three figures. The 

reverse is less exciting; a silen bending forward over his left foot, which rests on a 

rock-pile, admonishes a rather haughty looking maenad, who holds a thyrsus in her 

left hand; she wears a long chiton, with a dot-stripe border at the lower hem, and a 

black stripe down the side. The saltire squares which accompany the meanders are 

the same as those on Louvre K241 (no. 98) and are of the type regularly found on 

the vases of the Dirce Painter and his followers. 

The three fragmentary vases (nos. 102-4) all represent the old phlyax, with 

receding white hair and strongly marked white eyebrows. On nos. 103 and 104 he 

holds a curiously twisted stick, with a curved handle. One would have liked to see 

more of both nos. 102 and 104, since from what remains it is difficult to reconstruct 

the scenes. On the former it would appear that there was a seated figure upon an 

altar, on either side of whom was another figure (only the one to left is preserved, 

and part of the foot of the other); perhaps one of the not infrequent scenes where the 

errant slave seeks refuge from his master. On no. 104 there are traces of a figure 

wearing a Phrygian cap beside the old phlyax; this, as Schauenburg points out 

(Wandlungen, p. 189), raises a number of possibilities, like Paris, Pelops or Orpheus, of 

which the first is perhaps the most likely. 

It is perhaps worth noting that two of these fragments (nos. 103-4) come from 

vases of shapes not found at Paestum�the rhyton and the si tula. The former is most 

exceptional, since this shape is largely confined to Apulian; situlae, however, 

though more widely used in Apulian, are found in Campanian (see Schauenburg, 

loc. cit., p. 191, note 2). The chevron framing on no. 104 is repeated on the Geneva 

Orestes amphora (no. 2/1). The appearance of the rhyton lends a little support to the 

suggestion that this vase is more likely to have been made in Sicily than at Paestum. 

(iii) The Herakles and Apollo phlyax krater in Leningrad 

Bell-krater 

*105 Leningrad 1660 (St. 1777). Ht. 32. PLATE \3e,f 
PP, no. 35, fig. 16; PPSupp, no. 45; PhV, p. 33, no. 32 (where bibliography); Neverov, 
Kultura, ill. on p. 151; Kurt Galinsky. The Herakles Theme, p. 95, pi. 9, fig. 13. 
(a) Phlyax scene�Herakles threatening Apollo at Delphi, (b) draped woman, holding 
cista, and nude youth with fillet and tambourine. 

This is a remarkable vase and extremely difficult to place. The subject is both 

interesting and amusing and presents few problems in interpretation. Herakles has 

come to Delphi to seek purification from Apollo for the murder of Linus. When 

See H. Hoffmann, Tarentine Rhyta, pp. 93 ff.; he lists seven rhyta (nos. 523-9 in his catalogue) as 

Lucanian and two as Paestan�Syracuse 29966 and a fragment in the University of Heidelberg, of 

which not enough remains in my opinion to identify it as belonging to that fabric. 

Apollo refused to do this, Herakles seized the Delphic tripod, and the two were 

reconciled only through the intervention of Zeus and Athena, a theme extremely 

popular in Attic vase-painting. In the phlyax version the scene is entirely different. 

Herakles stands on a three-legged table, perhaps intended as a parody of the tripod, 

and holds out a dish of cakes in one hand to Apollo, who has fled to the roof of the 

temple, still holding his bow and laurel-branch. In his other hand Herakles has his 

knotty club, ready to deal a blow to Apollo should he venture to take one of the cakes 

and thus probably cause him to fall into the louterion which stands immediately 

beneath him. To right is a third phlyax, presumably Iolaos, who holds up his right 

hand and seems to be shouting at Apollo. In the top left-hand corner hangs the mask 

of a white-haired and bearded phlyax (type L), and above Herakles is a wreath in 

added white to fill the otherwise empty space. 

The attribution of the vase, however, raises difficult problems. Zahn (FR iii, 

p. 191) assigned the vase to Asteas, but to his later period on the ground that the 

palmettes beside the handles were similar to those on the Apulianising volute-krater 

in Naples representing Jason and the golden fleece (3248; below no. 3/630). There is 

in fact only a very slight resemblance, the side-palmettes on the Leningrad krater 

being much closer to those on nos. 33, 39 and 41 above, which at least suggests a 

Sicilian connection. In PP and PPSupp the vase was also assigned to Asteas, but I 

now believe that the reverse rules out such an attribution, since there is no parallel to 

it on any of that painter's other vases. It shows a standing woman, wearing a chiton 

over which a himation is wrapped, and a nude youth facing her, with a white fillet in 

his right hand and a small tambourine in his left. Such a scene is completely out of 

keeping with any of the known reverses of Asteas, even that of the Oxford phlyax 

skyphos (1945.43; below, no. 2/33), which is itself exceptional. Nor are there any 

convincing parallels for it on the reverses of the phlyax vases considered above. On 

the other hand, the phlyax scene on the obverse is in the typical Sicilian-Paestan 

manner. We have already seen on nos. 99, 102-4 above, the characteristic use of a 

red padded jerkin, over which a short tunic, often in added white, may be worn, and 

this practice is repeated on several of the vases attributed to Asteas (e.g. nos. 2/19, 

22, 26, 36, 45, 51, 64), as well as on his signed phlyax krater in Berlin (no. 2/125). We 

should also note the presence of a white stripe, marking the seam, which runs down 

the arms and legs of the phlyax costume, as on nos. 100 and 102, and on many vases 

from the Asteas-Python workshop; where its appearance may be regarded as almost 

standard practice, although it is not found in Apulian or Campanian. 

On balance, the Leningrad krater seems to me best placed in the present 

context. The obverse is close to that of Lipari 927 (no. 99) and to some of the early 

phlyax vases of Asteas, as mentioned above; the reverse can hardly be regarded as 

true Paestan, but it finds at least distant connections with those of vases in the 

Sicilian Group, and it seems reasonable, in consequence, to place it among those 

vases which mark the transition from the Sicilian forerunners to the standard 

Paestan style. 

At this stage we might look at two other vases, which seem to stand between Sici

and Paestan, but which do not find a place in either of the two preceding sections. 

(i) The Malibu Neck-amphora 

Neck-amphora 

*106 Malibu 80 AE 153. Ht. 41. PLATE 14a,i 
(a) Two youths, with petasoi and staffs, standing beside a tomb-monument, in front of 
which is seated on an altar a draped woman holding a phiale and a fillet, [b) draped woman 
with mirror held out in her r. hand, nude youth with drapery over his 1. arm. 
Neck: (a) female head, in profile to 1., wearing saccos, [b) owl; both between laurel 
branches. 

The subject of the obverse would appear to be a simplified version of the 

meeting of Orestes and Pylades with Electra at the tomb of Agamemnon. Both 

youths wear a short chlamys, fastened at the neck by a brooch, a petasos hanging 

down behind their heads, and high laced boots; each carries a stick. We may 

therefore assume them to be travellers, and it is in this guise that Orestes and Pylades 

are normally shown (cf. Geneva HR29; no. 2/1). The woman is seated in profile to 

left on an altar in front of a column, round the shaft of which is looped a red fillet. 

She wears a chiton with a double dot-stripe running down the left side, a white-

studded girdle, and has a piece of dot-stripe bordered drapery across the lower part 

of her body. In her left hand she holds a phiale, not the hydria which is usually 

associated with Electra in this context, but it is difficult to think of her as anyone else, 

since the scene follows so closely the regular composition for this theme. On the 

reverse, a woman with a dot-stripe bordered cloak on top of her tunic and draped 

over her right shoulder holds out a mirror in her left hand; before her stands a nude 

youth, a piece of drapery "wrapped around his left arm and falling down towards the 

ground. Between them is a very low altar or stele. The stance and draping of the 

woman recall the figures on the reverses of kraters by the Painter of Louvre K 236 

(e.g. nos. 62-4). On the neck of the obverse are the head and shoulders of a woman, 

seen in profile to left, wearing a saccos decorated with rows of dots, from which a 

large bunch of curly hair emerges to cover the left ear, from which hangs a three-

bead earring. Round the shoulder runs a laurel-wreath meeting in a central white 

flower, which has now disappeared. The drawing of the faces, the rendering of the 

drapery, the treatment of the reverse all have a good deal in common with early 

Paestan, but the vase does not seem quite to belong to the fabric and it is therefore 

better to think of it rather as an immediate forerunner, which may well have had 

some influence on the Geneva amphora. It is unfortunate that there is no record of 

its find-spot. 

(ii) The Mormino Hydria 

Hydria 

* 107 Palermo, Bank of Sicily�Mormino coll. 385, from Selinunte. Ht. 25-1. Recomposed from 
fragments, with some restoration. PLATE 14 c 
Ode'on, p. 36, no. 43, pi. 15 c-d; Beck, Album of Greek Education, fig. 367. 
Orpheus, with lyre in 1. hand, seated between two women (Muses ?), to 1. with lyre, to r. 
holding out scroll above open box. 
Below the handles: female heads. 

Like the Getty amphora, this vase is not easy to place. It is certainly not Atti

the manner of the Meidias Painter, as Tusa suggests in Odion, nor can it be as early as 

420-410 B.C.; it looks rather to be Sicilian, but with strong affinities, especially in the 

shape and decoration and in the treatment of the drapery, to early Paestan. 

The seated male figure in the centre of the obverse is wearing Oriental costume 

and is therefore most probably Orpheus. He wears a Phrygian cap, a chlamys 

fastened at the throat with a brooch, a chiton with embroidered star patterns, over 

an undergarment decorated with long double ray-pattern on the sleeves and on the 

trouser-legs. In his left hand he holds a cithara, in his right the plectrum; he turns his 

head to right to look at a woman who holds out an open scroll. She wears a chiton, 

with a black-bordered piece of drapery across the lower part of her body. To left 

another woman holds a cithara; she is more elaborately dressed and the piece of 

drapery around her body has a chequer-patterned border. Orpheus, with his 

elaborate drapery, finds a series of remarkable counterparts in several represent 

ations of Paris on Paestan vases, notably Brussels A 813 and Paestum 26631, and in 

that of Apollo on Louvre K570. Ray-patterns and chequer borders are especially 

popular with Asteas and Python. Beneath the side-handles are female heads, and 

this, too, is a favourite device of these two painters; it is a practice found also in 

Campanian, though not to the same extent, and is still rarer in Apulian, where from 

c. 350 onwards, palmettes are normally used instead. A comparison between the 

heads on the Mormino hydria and those on nos. 2/1 and 3 by the Painter of the 

Geneva Orestes shows a remarkable similarity in treatment, especially in the drawing 

of the eyes and the rendering of the nose, mouth and chin (cf. also with Madrid 

11142, Hillsborough 23 and Vienna 581�nos. 2/13, 27 and 28). The laurel-wreath 

on the shoulder is also frequently found in Paestan (e.g. on Madrid 11137-8 = nos. 

2/12 and 3), but the palmettes which flank the main picture are not of the standard 

Paestan type. It is also unlikely that a vase made in Paestum would have found its 

way to Selinunte, and it is therefore probable that the hydria is also of Sicilian origin, 

but very closely related to early Paestan.

We are fortunate in being able to identify by name two of the principal Paestan 

painters, since eleven vases bearing the signature of Asteas and two that of Python 

are at present known to us. Both sign with eypcttpe, using the imperfect rather than 

the aorist eypayE, which is the regular form on Attic vases. Asteas is a rare name; it 

occurs only once in literature, as the name of a Pythagorean philosopher at 

Tarentum, though it appears in several Greek inscriptions. The vase-painter 

always spells his name with a double sigma in the first syllable, but this spelling is 

not found elsewhere and may be regarded as a mannerism. The name Python is of 

more frequent occurrence; it was also that of an Athenian potter who made cups 

signed by Epiktetos and Douris.

Reference has already been made (p. 9) to the similarity between the styles of 

Asteas and Python. From the evidence at present available, it looks as if Python 

began his artistic career somewhat later than Asteas, since, with the exception of 

Berlin 4532, none of the former's vases has the earlier type of palmette-fans with 

attached side-scrolls or with hooked leaves found on the latter's earlier work (as on 

Figs. 3, IIIA; IVA), nor do the draped youths on his reverses have plain black 

borders to their himatia, but, from the start, have a dot-stripe, which becomes more 

pronounced as his style develops. It is, therefore, not unlikely that Python was the 

pupil of Asteas. The two painters must have worked in the closest collaboration, and 

it is often far from easy to distinguish the work of the one from that of the other. This 

is particularly true of the very large number of smaller vases from their workshop, 

since these are often decorated with single figures excerpted from larger compo 

sitions, but often lacking those individual features which would serve clearly to 

distinguish them. For that reason, most of those vases, for which one would hesitate 

to make a specific attribution, are grouped together in Chapter IX as 'Minor Vases 

from the workshop of Asteas and Python'. 

The material that has come to light in recent years has enabled us to identify at 

least some of the other painters in the workshop, to whom Beazley has referred as the 

'On signatures in general, see R. M. Cook, Greek Painted Pottery, pp. 254�5; f-ypo^e is used twice by 

Euthymides [ARV, p. 28, nos. 12 and 18) and, later, by Aristophanes [ARV, p. 1319, nos. 1-2). On 

Asteas, see Margherita Guarducci, Epigrafia greca iii (Rome, 1974), p. 485. 

Iamblichus, Vita Pythag. 36, 267. 

Notably CIG, II, i, 448; III, iii, 45 b, 5; II, v, 2957; V, ii, 415, 9; V, ii, 38; V, ii, 74. The form Astias 

is also found [CIG, IV, 1484 and 1485), and this may be compared with the two forms Chaireas and 

Chairias. Asteas is presumably connected with 6<nv, as Demeas with Sfiuos. 

The double sigma is found on other vases, e.g. 'AaCTTEpoirri and KdaoTcop on the Meidias 

Painter's hydria in the B.M., and in inscriptions (cf. Arisstodamus, Telesstas, etc.), but it is not 

common, and usually occurs before a tau (note, however, hZZITEPIAlE on the Asteas lekythos). For a 

discussion of the point see Franz, Elem. Epig. Gr., p. 49; Blass, Aussprache des Griech., p. 37. 

Seefl�xxiv, 611 ff. 

Bloesch, Formen attischer Schalen, p. 28, no. 13 and pp. 96-101; Beazley, ARV, p. 1554, where the 

four vases bearing Python's signature are listed. 

'No. 272 below. The side palmette-scrolls on this vase are without parallel; they must be regarded 

as a sort of'throw-back' to those of the earlier period, since the treatment of the draped youths on the 

reverse show the vase to be a work of Python's mature phase. 

'extremely well-drilled associates' of Asteas and Python, and no doubt they were 

responsible for some of the minor vases. Of the new painters (see Chapter VIII) two 

are of particular interest�the Painter of Wurzburg H 5739, whose style is very close 

to that of the two masters, and the Aphrodite Painter (see Chapter X, 1), who was 

probably trained in Apulia, since he brought to Paestum a number of purely 

Apulian decorative motifs. Once established, however, in the workshop of Asteas 

and Python, he rapidly paestanises and adapts his style to meet the local require 

ments; this is very evident from his use of frames for his pictures and from his 

treatment of the drapery, as well as his adoption of a non-Apulian shape like the 

neck-amphora. 

It will be noted that many of the vases listed in PP and PPSupp as belonging to 

the 'Asteas Group' have been reclassified; their number has been greatly increased as 

a result of recent excavations and it now looks as if more of them, especially on the 

basis of the draped youths on their reverses, may be attributed to the hand of Asteas 

himself. Certain changes and developments will be observed in the pattern-work, the 

drawing of the figures and the rendering of the drapery, but they do not appear 

inconsistent with those that might normally be expected to take place in the quarter-

century or so of the artist's activity. It now also seems probable that those vases 

attributed in PPSupp to the 'Altavilla Painter' represent an early phase of the work of 

Python, as indeed Beazley had already suggested (A J A 48, 1944, p. 363) might well 

be the case, in his discussion of the Oxford and Cambridge bell-kraters (nos. 285 and 

286 below). 

It is primarily to Asteas that the credit must be given for establishing the canons 

which were to govern Paestan vase-decoration throughout the life of the fabric. The 

influence on Asteas of his Sicilian forerunners and, more particularly, of the 

transitional artists like the Painter of Louvre K 240, is very clear, but he succeeded in 

transforming those elements which he took from them into something that became 

essentially Paestan�the typical detached framing palmettes provide an outstanding 

example. We see the same process at work, however, in his treatment of draped 

youths; in a comparatively short time they acquire a character of their own, in both 

pose and draping, which distinguishes them at once from the youths on the reverses 

of other South Italian vases. The same is also true of other stock figures in the 

Paestan repertory�in particular, Dionysos, a piece of drapery, inevitably with a 

dot-stripe border, somewhere across his body, as he sits upon a tendril or an enclosed 

palmette, or runs to right or left, an ivy-wreath around his head, a thyrsus in one 

hand; the standing draped woman, with the dot-stripe down her peplos; the satyr 

bending forward; the papposilen with the little tufts of white hair; the phlyax actor, 

wearing tights with a red jerkin and a white tunic over them. All these figures are 

repeated from one vase to another, with only minor variations; most of them can be 

recognised at once as Paestan, thanks to the prototypes so firmly established by 

Asteas. It is not until the later Apulianising phase that any serious departure from 

these canons is to be observed and this is no doubt due to the fact that the migrant 

Apulian painters were unfamiliar with the tradition of Paestan vase-decoration and, 

unlike the Aphrodite Painter, were unwilling to adapt their art to the local style (see 

Chapter XIII). 

Although there is a very clear distinction between the earlier vases by Asteas 

and the later work of Python, there is a substantial area of overlap between these two 

painters, when both are decorating vases of similar shape in much the same manner 

and when both are trying to outdo each other in painting grandiose and pretentious 

mythological scenes, which are really beyond their somewhat limited artistic talents, 

but which they seem to have rated highly, since it is only on vases of this type that we 

find their signatures. As Beazley has noted, it is in the smaller two-figure compo 

sitions that we see their work at its best, with its 'agreeable tang of popular, 

provincial art'. 

On stylistic evidence it seems probable that the earlier work of Asteas should be 

dated just before the middle of the fourth century B.C., let us say around 360, and 

that his career continued until the thirties; Python is, therefore, likely to have been 

active through the third quarter of the century, the later painters in the workshop, 

like the Aphrodite and Boston Orestes Painters, going down to c. 320 B.C. 

This chapter deals with the first vases which may with reasonable certainty be 

regarded as true Paestan and is primarily concerned with the earlier work of Asteas, 

with which that of the Painter of the Geneva Orestes is contemporary. 

The painter takes his name from the neck-amphora in Geneva (no. 1), showing the 

meeting of Orestes and Electra at the tomb of Agamemnon. Its provenience is 

unfortunately not recorded; however, the lebes gamikos (no. 4) was found at 

Paestum, as were the two fragments (nos. 5-6) associated in style with this painter, if 

not by his own hand, and there is a strong probability that the Madrid hydria 

(no. 3) also came from that site, since it was formerly in the Salamanca collection. 

The Painter of the Geneva Orestes may, therefore, be regarded as almost certainly a 

true Paestan; his style is still connected with that of the Sicilian forerunners, but 

stands a little apart from that of the other vases in this chapter, most of which seem to 

be early works by Asteas. 

We may begin with the painter's name vase and a fragment very close to it in 

style:

Fragment (of a neck-amphora)

Upper part of woman, with basket upon her head, clasping the shaft of an Ionic column 
(from a funerary monument) with her r. hand. 

The neck-amphora, of which there are a few examples in early Sicilian (e.g. 

Syracuse 42853 = LCS, p. 586, no. 15; Melbourne 1342/5 = LCS, p. 588, no. 25), 

together with one classed as transitional (no. 1/106 above), is to become a very 

popular shape at Paestum (as also in Campanian), where it will be found 

throughout the life of the fabric. Its height varies considerably, from comparatively 

small examples (c. 20-25 cm.), through what may be regarded as the 'standard' size 

(c. 40-50 cm.), to some of much larger dimensions (c. 60-70 cm.), in one instance 

(no. 963 below) approaching an almost monumental scale (91-5 cm.), though this is 

an exception and, since it is by the Aphrodite Painter, may well reflect the influence 

of Apulian, where such huge vases are of frequent occurrence. The typical Paestan 

'The neck-amphora is not normally found in Apulian or Lucanian. There is an early Apulian 

example, from the very beginning of the fabric, by the Painter of the Berlin Dancing Girl (Lecce 

571 = RVAp I, p. 7, no. 13), presumably based on an Attic prototype, but thereafter it is the amphora of 

panathenaic shape which comes into general use. 

neck-amphora of medium size usually has figures in metope-like panels on the 

neck�a siren or a female head being most commonly represented. The decoration of 

the Geneva amphora follows the regular pattern, with a siren (who accompanies the 

soul from this world to the next) on one side of the neck and a female head on the 

other. The shoulder is decorated on the obverse with laurel-wreaths meeting in a 

central flower (also a common Paestan pattern), then a band of tongues, and one of 

ovoli on top of the picture; on the reverse, wave is substituted for the laurel, and a 

reserved stripe runs across the top of the scene. On the obverse the picture is framed 

between reserved bands filled with a black chevron-pattern, as on the situla 

fragment (no. 1/104 above); on the reverse there are simply vertical reserved bands, 

like those which frame the panel on the neck of the obverse, and these also will 

frequently reappear on other Paestan vases. The stopt meanders are accompanied 

by two chequered squares (as in Sicilian) and two sal tires. Below the handles are two 

superposed palmette-fans, with a tall central leaf flanked by leaves which curl 

inwards (sprung), unlike the remainder. Side-scrolls with fans, curling leaves, and, 

on either side at the top, a large lotus-like flower springs out from beneath the two 

large fans, the core of which is decorated with a black design resembling a mushroom 

(as also on no. 4). 

The main scene on the obverse gives a fuller and more detailed version of that 

on the Malibu amphora (no. 1/106). The tomb monument now takes the form of a 

white Ionic column, the fluting rendered in dilute glaze; it rests upon a three-stepped 

base, on which are two rows of offerings, probably eggs above and cakes (or 

pomegranates) below, with a red fillet between them. On the right Electra kneels on 

the base�an unusual pose�with a metal phiale in her left hand, while she appears 

to be lifting with her right the lid of a hydria, also shown in white with diluted glaze 

like the phiale, to represent a metal original. She has short hair, appropriate for a 

mourner, and wears a pink chiton, decorated down the centre with a double dot-

stripe in white; over her left shoulder and across the lower part of her body is draped 

a cloak with a chequer border (cf. the Mormino hydria, no. 1/107), enlivened by a 

row of white dots on either side. To left and right stand Orestes and Pylades, both 

dressed and equipped in the same way. Each wears a chlamys, fastened at the throat 

by a white brooch and carries two spears and a short sword in a white sheath; both 

have petasoi, attached by white ribbons, one seen from inside, the other from 

outside. Above are the busts of two winged Furies, their heads encircled by snakes; 

the one to right has a white snake coiled round her right arm. They are destined to 

play an important role after the murder of Clyternnestra, and they also serve to 

indicate that this is more than a simple funerary scene. The scene will be repeated 

with minor variations on a fragmentary neck-amphora by Asteas (no. 144 below), 

where the Furies are named as Megaira and Teisiphone, and on the Boston Orestes 

amphora (inv. 99.540 = no. 1004), where the two youths stand together on the left 

of the column, with Electra in a black tunic on the right. It is worth noting that all 

three vases have a siren on the neck of the obverse. 

We should look particularly at the features of the five figures on the obverse; 

their faces are strongly defined, with a high brow, marked by two short parallel lines; 

the pupil of the eye is large, the eyebrow sometimes arched; the nose has an outward 

curve, at times with a pointed tip; the lower lip is full and fleshy, the chin prominent 

and rounded. The hair is shown as a solid mass, sometimes with strands falling down 

on to the shoulders (the Furies and Orestes). The wing of the bird-part of the siren 

has a white edge, an area of black relieved with white dots, and rows of black dots 

and a wash of diluted glaze on the individual feathers, as on the wings of the Furies, 

and on those of Eros on no. 3. The female head on the neck of the reverse has the hair 

caught up in a plain kekryphalos, decorated with a row of dots; there is a radiate 

stephane across the hair above the brow, and a bunch of hair emerges at the back, 

with a ring of white beads around it. Her face is drawn in much the same manner as 

those on the obverse and is particularly close to that of the draped woman in the 

main scene on the reverse. We shall see very similar heads below the handles of the 

hydria by this painter (no. 3) and on many of those listed in section 2 below. 

The main scene on the reverse is of particular stylistic importance for the link it 

provides between those on some of the vases of Sicilian origin which we have already 

considered, and those on the Paestan vases which follow. The composition as a 

whole�a nude youth between two draped figures�takes us back to the reverse of 

the Dublin krater by the Sikon Painter (no. 1/79 above), where the figure to left 

(although female) is draped in a manner not unlike that of the corresponding youth 

on our vase. A closer comparison will, however, be seen on the reverse of Louvre 

K241 (no. 1/98 above), where we have again a similar composition, with a 

considerable measure of correspondence between the drapery, and in the leafy 

wreath worn by the youth to left. The draped figures on the Orestes amphora well 

conform to what will become stock Paestan types�the figure to left, with the 'sling' 

drape for his right arm is type A 1 (see fig. 2), holding a spray in his concealed right 

hand, the other has the 'sleeve' drape (type A 2), again with a spray. The dot-stripe 

borders, and the wavy pattern they make at the bottom corner are also very 

characteristic of the developed Paestan style. We see here, then, what are the 

prototypes of a vast number of draped figures on Paestan vases. 

The small fragment, also from a neck-amphora, recently presented to the 

Metropolitan Museum by Dr. D. von Bothmer, goes closely with the Geneva vase 

and must originally have represented a similar subject. All that remains is the near-

frontal figure of a woman, who supports on her head a large basket of white and 

purple-red fillets, doubtless intended for the decking of a tomb. She is comparable to 

the canephoros on the Dirce Painter's Orestes krater (no. 1/1 above), and it is 

noteworthy here that the basket is decorated on the edge with the double ray-

pattern, used on the drapery of Orpheus on no. 1/107, and common on the more 

elaborate Paestan draperies. The woman wears a thin peplos, through which one 

breast is clearly visible, and a necklace of white beads, like the siren on no. 1. Her 

hair is short, centrally parted on the brow; the eyes have white highlights and large 

black pupils. The drawing is very close to that of the figures on the Geneva amphora, 

and there can be little doubt that this fragment is by the same hand, perhaps from a 

companion vase. 

Two other vases may be attributed to the same painter: 

Hydria 

*3 Madrid 11138 (L. 422). Ht. 37. PLATE 16b-d 
PP, no. 81; PPSupp, no. 88. 
Eros bending forward to 1., holding open wreath in both hands, between, to 1., standing 
draped woman with fillet in r., cista and wreath in 1. and, to r., draped woman holding 
mirror. 
Below the handles: 1., female head; r., head of youth (Hermes ?), wearing petasos. 

Lebes gamikos 

*4 Paestum IV/452, from the area of the Heraion, Loc. IV. Ht. (to top of vase) 14; the handles 
have been restored. PLATE 16 e 
PP-s, NF 6; PAdd, no. A 33. 
(a) Nude woman seated on pillar, holding phiale in 1. hand, [b) Eros running to 1. 

The Madrid hydria is not unlike the Mormino hydria (no. 1/107) in its 

composition, with three figures in the main picture and a profile head below each of 

the two side-handles. This indeed becomes the standard decoration for Paestan 

hydriai between c. 35 and 45 cm. in height, with a two-figure composition being used 

for those of slightly smaller dimensions. The heads are generally those of women, but 

occasionally male heads appear, that of a satyr or of a youth, as on this vase, where 

the head is probably that of Hermes, since it is wearing a petasos. The stylistic 

connection with the Geneva amphora is clear; we may note (i) the similarity 

between the two profile heads below the handles and that on the neck of the reverse 

of the amphora, especially in the rendering of the eye, with its large black pupil, (ii) 

the parallel between the standing draped woman to right and the corresponding 

figure on the reverse of the Geneva vase, particularly in the drawing of the face and 

the treatment of the head-dress and the drapery, (iii) the rendering of the wings of 

Eros as compared with those of the Furies (white outline) or of the siren (dotted 

feathers with diluted glaze wash); the wings of Eros on no. 4 are also comparable. Of 

particular interest on the Madrid hydria is the use of a double dot-stripe running 

down the centre of the peplos, with a white line on the black area between the two 

rows of dots. We shall see this pattern again very frequently on the early vases of 

Asteas and it may be regarded as typically Paestan; note also how the stripe veers a 

little to one side below the girdle. The pattern-work is also worthy of note: from the 

base of the palmette-fan below the back handle, there springs on each side a tendril 

with an inward curving leaf at the top and a spiral curling out below it, with a 

diamond floral above and a small palmette-fan below, a modification of the pattern 

on vases like Louvre K 240 and S. Agata 66 (nos. 1/94-5 above) and moving towards 

that on Paestum 20386 and Melbourne D 391/1980 by Asteas (nos. 23-4 below). 

The small lebes gamikos (no. 4) comes from the area of the Heraion at Paestum 

and represents on one side a nude woman (comparatively rare in Paestan) seated on 

a pillar and holding out a phiale in her left hand; from the other side Eros runs 

towards her, an expectant look upon his face. The sharp nose and rounded chin, 

quite deeply indented, remind us of the face of Pylades to right on the obverse of the 

Geneva amphora or of the youth in the centre of the scene on its reverse; the eyes, 

too, have the large pupils characteristic of this painter. The pattern-work is similar 

to that on the Madrid hydria, except that there is a drop-leaf instead of a palmette-

fan below the spiral; the core of the palmette is decorated with a black mushroom-

shaped object, as on no. 1, and the reverse wave below the pictures is similar to that 

on the hydria. 

Two small fragments, both found at Paestum, might also find a place here, in 

view of their pattern-work and the drawing of the silen's eye on no. 5, but from what 

remains it is difficult to be certain, and they might also have been placed in the next 

section. They are clearly both early Paestan.

2. EARLY VASES BY ASTEAS 

The early vases of Asteas, most of which precede the more elaborately decorated 

vases which bear his signature (Chapter V) or have been attributed to his hand 

(Chapter VI), are remarkable for their uniformity of shape, style and decoration. 

About half of the vases in this section are bell-kraters, normally decorated with a 

two-figure composition on the obverse and with two draped youths on the reverse. 

Two kraters only, nos. 7 and 21, have a single figure on each side, one (no. 10) has a 

three-figure composition on the obverse; no. 23 has Dionysos and a silen on the 

reverse in place of the normal two draped youths. The two-figure compositions on 

the obverses are also very consistent; they normally depict Dionysos in the company 

of, most commonly, a satyr or bearded silen (19), the latter sometimes with white 

hair (4), Eros (4), a maenad (4), Pan (3) or a phlyax actor (7). Two kraters (nos. 19 

and 45), and a skyphos (no. 33), show a phlyax scene without Dionysos, and comic 

masks appear on several other vases (nos. 9, 24, 33, 58). In the scenes themselves we 

may also note the frequent repetition of what are to become 'stock figures' in the 

Paestan repertory: 

(i) the half-draped seated youth or Dionysos, wearing a dotted fillet round his 

head, knotted at the back and decorated with ivy-leaves or white beads, and a piece 

of drapery, with a dot-stripe border, over the lower part of his body; 

(ii) a similar figure, but standing, bending slightly forward or running, with the 

piece of drapery across the front of the body or behind it and over one arm; 

(iii) the standing woman or maenad, wearing a peplos with an overfall 

decorated with a double dot-stripe running down the centre, which veers slightly to 

one side of the lower part of the garment, where it emerges from beneath the overfall 

(cf. Madrid 11138 by the Painter of the Geneva Orestes, no. 3 above); sometimes 

there is a stripe in added white on the black area between the two lines of dots; 

(iv) the young snub-nosed satyr, with pointed ears and occasionally with small 

goat-horns on the brow (Pan satyr); 

(v) the bearded silen, sometimes shown as slightly balding; and 

(vi) his counterpart, the papposilen, with white hair and beard, who may (as on 

no. 50) wear a close-fitting garment covered with tufts of white hair to simulate a 

shaggy body. 

The typical phlyax wears tights, often with white lines down the arms and legs 

to mark the seams, over which there is often a deep red jerkin to which a phallus is 

attached and on which the breasts are picked out in a pale pink; over this in turn 

there may be a well-padded short tunic, usually painted white, and so draped as to 

leave one shoulder bare. 

The draped youths on the reverses of the early bell-kraters invariably wear 

himatia with a plain black stripe on the border. For the youth on the left Types A 1 

('sling') and Bv (half-draped) are equally popular, for the one on the right A 2 is 

generally used, sometimes with the right hand visible or with the cloak drawn up to 

cover the back of the head (e.g. nos. 24-26). A wreath of some kind in added white is 

often worn, and, if one of the hands is exposed (Types A 1 r, A 2 r, B v, r, or 1), it will 

usually hold some object�a spray, an egg, a wreath, a 'skewer of fruit', or a stick. 

The rendering of the drapery is very characteristic, especially for Types A 1 and A 2; 

particularly noteworthy on the latter is the curving black line (not unlike a bracket 

in shape) which marks the edge of the 'sleeve', beneath which a series of vertical fold-

lines runs down to the lower border of the cloak, which often ends in an undulating 

curve, matching the one on the corresponding side. Occasionally there is a wavy fold 

line, shaped somewhat like a double S, on the cloak of the youth to right, just above 

the left foot (e.g. on nos. 35, 44, 46-7, 59, 60, 64); it reappears on some of the later 

vases (e.g. nos. 170-5, 181, 183). 

The influence of the Painter of Louvre K 240 is everywhere apparent in these 

early Paestan vases; much of his work is so similar in style and treatment that, were it 

not for the fact that several of his vases have a Sicilian provenience, one would be 

tempted to think of him as a Paestan and, as has already been suggested, he may well 

have migrated to the mainland at a late stage in his career. The pattern-work on 

many of the vases in this section is closely comparable to that on vases like Louvre 

K240 and 241 or S. Agata 66, and they have much else in common with them as 

well. Particularly noteworthy are the similarities in the treatment of: (i) Dionysos, 

especially in regard to the drawing of the face, the dotted fillet round the head 

decorated with ivy-leaves (cf. nos. 1/91, 95, 99-101), and the piece of drapery across 

his body; (ii) the white-haired silen with a red band round his head (cf. nos. 1/92, 

94�5); (iii) the bearded, balding silen (cf. nos. 1/91-2, 96-7 and reverse of 100); (iv) 

the white-haired phlyax (cf. nos. 1/99-104). There is also the regular use of a dot-

stripe border on the drapery. The draped and half-draped youths on the reverse of 

Louvre K241 (pi. 12 e) are closely comparable not only with those on the bell-

kraters in this section but also with those of the reverse of the Geneva amphora 

(no. 1; pi. 15b). One of the main points of difference lies in the meanders and 

chequers or saltire squares which appear below the pictures on the kraters by the 

Painter of Louvre K 240 as against the wave-pattern which is invariably used on the 

early Paestan kraters. 

That the vases in this section are early work by Asteas himself seems clear from a 

comparison between some of the figures represented upon them with the correspond 

ing ones on his signed vases, especially on the reverses. Good parallels to Dionysos, 

the bearded silen, the young satyr and the papposilen are readily found on nos. 

125-9 and 132-3; also for the maenads with their dot-striped drapery and for the 

black-dotted sphendonai which so regularly adorn the female heads below the handles 

of the hydriai in this section. The typical 'Asteas flower' (see above, p. 18, fig. 4), 

which accompanies the palmette-scrolls on the back of the Stheneboia hydria and 

the Hesperides lekythos (nos. 134�5), will also be found on some of the vases below 

(e.g. nos. 70, 80, 91). The drawing of the heads of the nymphs and of Hermes on 

no. 135 is also very close to that of many such heads on the early vases. Indeed, it 

would seem that the Hesperides lekythos (no. 135) and the Berlin phlyax krater (no. 

125), on the reverse of which are palmette-scrolls very similar to those on nos. 20 and 

21, are contemporary with some of the vases below and, therefore, probably the 

earliest of his signed works. Most of the vases in this section should belong to the last 

decade of the first half of the fourth century and the years immediately following (i.e. 

(i) Vases with 'hooked' drop-leaves 
(a) With attached side-scrolls (III A) 

The vases in this sub-division all have the same pattern-work below the handles or at 

the back. This is of Type III A in Fig. 3 and consists of a large palmette-fan, from the 

spirals at the base of which springs out a side-scroll or tendril with a large hook-like 

leaf curving inwards at the top, a spiral curving out from the stem with a single drop-

leaf above and a large hooked leaf descending from it below. The core of the fan-

palmette consists of a reserved fan-shaped area with a black dot in the centre; below 

the two spirals beneath it is a reserved triangle, and a single large leaf curves 

outward on either side. On Madrid 11142 (no. 13) and Mainz O. 29212 (no. 17), the 

space above the spiral on the stem is filled not with a leaf but with a small palmette-

fan, thus connecting these vases with those in (iii). 
Ill A 

Apart from the pattern-work, the uniformity of style and treatment is evident o

all the vases in this division; this is very clear in the draped youths on the reverses (cf. 

especially the youths to right on nos. 8, 9, 14; also with nos. 18-20; or the youths to 

left on nos. 8, 14, 18 and 20, or on 9 and 19), in the drawing of the head of Dionysos 

(nos. 8-10, 18), in the standing draped woman or maenad with the double dot-

stripe, sometimes with a white central line, running down her drapery (nos. 11-14, 

16-17 and 20), also in the rendering of the wings of Eros (nos. 9, 11, 14, 16 and 17). 

Such a high degree of repetition from one vase to another leaves little doubt that 

they are the work of the same hand. 

The three hydriai (nos. 11-13) should be compared with Madrid 11138 (no. 3) 

by the Painter of the Geneva Orestes; they are excellent examples of what is to 

become the standard two- or three-figure composition used for the decoration of 

such vases, along with heads beneath the side-handles. No. 11 is unusual in that the 

heads of an Amazon and a young satyr are substituted for the canonical female 

heads; they are, however, drawn in much the same manner. We may note on all of 

them the large black pupil in the eye, the heavy, rounded chin, with a marked indent 

above it, beneath a thick lower lip, and the somewhat vacant stare. The hair of the 

woman is bound up in a black-dotted sphendone, leaving a large mass above the brow, 

over the visible ear, and at the back of the head. There is a string of black beads 

(omitted on one head on no. 12) round the neck, and the fold-lines of the garment 

worn by the women are visible at the shoulders. On nos. 11 and 13 the picture runs 

up onto the shoulder of the vase; on no. 12, where this is flatter, it is decorated with 

on the neck and wave below the pictures. On nos. 16 and 17 it may be noted that on 

the palmette-fan at the back the two leaves flanking the tall central leaf are sprung, 

i.e. curve inward. 

The subject-matter of the vases in the division as a whole calls for little 

comment, though it is interesting to note the growing role played by phlyakes (mask 

on no. 9, phlyax actors on nos. 10 and 22 a), which is at its best in the amusing scene 

represented on no. 19, where the two figures bear the inscriptions (DPYNIZ and 

FTYPQN1AHI painted in white. Phrynis was a celebrated musician of the later fifth 

century and we may have here a comic version of his quarrel with the Spartan 

ephor over his musical innovations (Plutarch, Agis 10, 7). Pyronides seems also to 

have been used as a nickname for the general Myronides. The phlyakes certainly 

look back to those on the vases associated with the Painter of Louvre K 240. Deep 

red is used on both this vase and the fragment from S. Venera (no. 22 a) for their 

jerkins.

On the two following bell-kraters (nos. 20-1) there is no 'hooked' drop-leaf 

descending from the spiral (as on nos. 18-19), but only a simple leaf below it and 

beside the stem. The 'frame' is thus similar to those used on some of the contempor 

ary early Campanian bell-kraters by the Cassandra Painter (cf. LCS, p. 226, nos. 

4-5, pi. 83-4; Suppl. Ill, p. 116, nos. 5 a and b).

The following fragments were found at Santa Venera in Paestum; they 

probably come from the same bell-krater, which had a phlyax scene on the obverse 

and two draped youths on the reverse. What remains of the side-scrolls shows that 

they must originally have been similar to those on the above vases; the treatment of 

both the phlyax and the draped youths (cf. no. 10) also suggests that these fragments 

are rightly placed in the present context.

(ii) Vases with attached side-scrolls decorated with small palmette-fans (IV A)

The pattern-work on the bell-kraters in this division also serves to link them with the 

work of the Painter of Louvre K240, since the diamond florals which appear above 

the spirals on the side-scrolls of some of his vases (e.g. nos. 1/94�5, 97-8) will be 

found on the reverses of nos. 23 and 24, though otherwise their place is taken by 

small fan-palmettes (Type IV A), which mark a transitional stage to the completely 

detached Paestan 'framing' palmette (IV D), as on the vases in the next division. 

Similar attached side-scrolls will also be seen springing from the palmette-fans at the 

back of the four hydriai (nos. 27-30) and, with certain variations, on nos. 31-33. 
IV A 

Three of the bell-kraters (nos. 24�6) go very closely together and form a 

particularly coherent group; their reverses are almost identical; on each the youth to 

right has his cloak drawn up over his head (cf. no. 18). No. 23 is unusual in having a 

Dionysiac scene on both sides but is otherwise very similar in style to the other three. 

The Melbourne krater (no. 24) which is discussed in detail in my article in the Art 

Bulletin of Victoria (21, 1981, pp. 20-9) is of unusual interest. It shows a youthful 

Dionysos, nude save for a piece of drapery over both arms and behind his back, 

holding a thyrsus in his right hand and a phiale in his left, with a small white bell 

(reminiscent again of Louvre K240 and 241) hanging from the wrist; he faces a 

maenad, leaning in a relaxed pose against a pillar, holding up a spray of ivy in her 

right hand; behind her left arm and running diagonally across her body is a thyrsus, 

at the top of which a white-dotted fillet is looped, and in her left hand she holds the 

mask of an old phlyax (Type L), with white hair and beard. This actual phlyax 

reappears on B.M. F 188 (no 26), together with a very similar youthful Dionysos, 

but here the actor has on his head a kalathiskos, the basket crown worn by dancers at 

the Karneian festival, of which no doubt the scene is meant to represent a comic 

version, the dancer here being an old phlyax instead of a youth. The resemblance 

between the masks of the old phlyax on these two vases and that of Charinos on the 

Berlin krater signed by Asteas (no. 125) is striking and leaves little doubt that all 

three vases are the work of the same artist. It is in scenes like these that we see Asteas 

at his best. The old silen on no. 25, seated on a white-dotted rock, beside a rather 

solid-looking bird, probably intended for a duck, and holding a large skyphos in 

front of him with both hands, is another example of Asteas's skill in depicting the 

contrast between age and youth, as represented by Dionysos, who varies only in pose 

on nos. 24-26. 

The three hydriai (nos. 27-9) and the squat lekythos (no. 30) have the same 

type of attached side-scrolls with small palmette-fans on either side of the central 

spiral as nos. 23-6, as well as a very similar treatment of the subjects represented. 

Two of the hydriai (nos. 27-8) follow closely on in shape and style from Madrid 

11137 (no. 12), with three-figure compositions, a flattish shoulder decorated with a 

laurel-wreath, tongues on the neck and wave-pattern below the pictures. The heads 

below the handles on no. 27 are very like those on the Madrid hydria; on Vienna 581 

(no. 28), under the left side-handle is the head of a youth with a pilos on his head, 

and to right, that of a woman, wearing a close-fitting saccos with a bow on top; the 

drawing of the eyes, nose, mouth and chin, however, corresponds very closely with 

that of the more normal heads on the other hydriai. No. 29 follows the pattern of 

Madrid 11142 (no. 13) with a two-figure composition which runs up onto the 

shoulder and with very similar female heads below the handles. The palmette-fan 

and side-scrolls at the back are almost identical with those on no. 27; the tendril 

between the two figures is repeated, usually without the touches of white, on nos. 70, 

75, 77, 95-7. The figures depicted upon nos. 24-30 all come from the artist's stock 

repertory, even to the little bell round the wrist of the Pan-satyr on no. 28. 

The pose of Hermes on Vienna 581 (no. 28) is of interest, as showing a variation 

on the popular pose of the figure bending forward over one leg which rests upon 

some type of elevation; here the chest sags downwards, so that both nipples become 

visible, and the space between the chest and the raised thigh is like a flat rectangle. 

�On the Karneian basket see, in particular, A. B. Cook, Zeus iii, pp. 996 ff., where this vase is 

discussed and illustrated on p. 1000. 

Paestum 20386 (no. 23) is of importance for the chronology of this group since it 

was found together with several vases by the Thyrsus Painter (20387-93; see above, 

p. 19) and should therefore be one of the earliest vases by Asteas, to be dated around 

360 B.C.

date those by Asteas, but Paestum 48456 (no. 102) was also found with a vase by the Thyrsus Painter 

(48464), which suggests some measure of overlap between the two painters.

On the three vases in the sub-division we may note a slight variation in the treatment 

of the palmette-fans of the side-scrolls, in that the leaves of the fan below the central 

spiral now point upward instead of downward. The leaves flanking the central leaf in 

the large palmette-fan below the back-handle of no. 31 are sprung, exactly as on 

Paestum 22449 (no. 15), otherwise the pattern-work is remarkably alike on all three 

vases, both nos. 30 and 31 having a large rosette (or possibly a phiale) beside the fan, 

and identical cores and side-leaves. They are similar on the skyphos, but here the 

space above the spirals is filled only with drop-leaves or floral forms, similar to those 

on the reverse of nos. 23-4 or on some of the vases in division (i). 

The hydria (no. 31) is of interest for the appearance on it of owls below the side-

handles instead of the usual heads (cf. Paestum 1741 and Louvre K24, nos. 69 and 

120 below). The drawing, especially of the faces, on these three vases is of rather 

lower quality, and it may be that they are the work of another painter in the same 

workshop. 

The Oxford skyphos shows a female tumbler on a turn-table and her acrobatic 

pose takes us back to the similar figure on Lipari 927 (no. 1/99 above), from which 

the painter may well have drawn his inspiration for this vase. Instead of the masked 

busts which appear in the windows above the scene on that vase, we have here only a 

comic female mask (Type S) in added white (now largely disappeared) suspended 

above.

(iii) Vases with 'standard' Paestan framing palmettes (IV D) 

With few exceptions (notably the neck-amphorae and some pelikai) the vases in this 

division have the 'standard' Paestan framing palmettes on either side of the scenes 

depicted upon them. The side palmette-scroll is now completely detached from the 

fan below the handles, which has a triangular or semi-circular base without spirals; 

the side-scroll stands upright, with a small palmette-fan above and below the spiral 

which springs out about half-way up the stem. In this form the framing palmette will 

persist throughout the life of the fabric, although in its latest phase the lower fan is 

sometimes omitted (Type V). 
IV D 

Of the 67 vases in this division, 34 are bell-kraters and 20 hydriai, which 

suggests a decided preference for those two shapes at this period. 

Bell-kraters 

All the bell-kraters have two-figure compositions on their obverses and Dionysos is 

represented on all but two (nos. 38 and 45). He is usually in the company of a young 

satyr (15 times), less frequently with a phlyax actor (5), Eros (3), Pan (3), a maenad, 

a bearded silen or a papposilen (twice each). In appearance he changes but little; he 

wears the customary dotted fillet round his head; when he is seated, a piece of 

drapery with a dot-stripe border covers the lower part of his body, when standing or 

running, he will have a similar piece of drapery over one arm (nos. 35, 37, 39, 42-3, 

51), or else behind his legs, sometimes passing over the right thigh (as on nos. 36, 41, 

59). He usually sits upon an enclosed white palmette or a tendril (as on nos. 50, 55, 

60-2; cf. also the silen on no. 58), or by an altar (nos. 53, 63, 65), and, in addition to 

his thyrsus, may carry a drinking-horn (nos. 35, 37, 42, 63), a phiale (nos. 39, 44, 51, 

57, 61), an egg (nos. 43, 50, 56, 60), or some other object such as a wreath, a bell or a 

tambourine. On no. 61 a small bird is perched on his extended right hand. The 

maenad on nos. 35 and 38, wearing a peplos with a double dot-stripe running down 

it, is already familiar to us from nos. 11-12, 16-17 and 20; the row of white beads (or 

buttons) down the upper part of the sleeve on no. 35 recurs on several later vases 

(e.g. nos. 45, 129, 136, 142, 164, 278, 337, 347, 379, 1036, on many of which only the 

upper part of the body is shown). 

In the bell-krater Naples 905 (no. 65) Patroni saw signs of a change from the 

style of Asteas and assigned it to a transitional group; the reverse differs slightly from 

those of the other kraters in that both youths are only half-draped, but they are 

drawn very much in the manner of Asteas and the vase seems to me to be best placed 

here. 

The other figures call for no special comment, but we might note an indication 

of a game of kottabos on no. 62 in the small kylix held by Dionysos with his finger 

through the handle, as also by the satyr on no. 37 and the papposilen on no. 50, since 

this, together with the appearance of drinking-horns suggest that such scenes are 

connected with symposia (see Rolf Hurschmann, Symposienszenen, pp. 24�5). The 

phlyax actors all wear the typical costume�a slightly padded red jerkin, with 

tightly fitting hose covering the arms and legs, and a large phallus. Touches of white 

are often added to the eyes, and on older phlyakes there is a large blob of white on 

the space between the eyes and the eyebrow, which is strongly arched, as on some 

earlier examples (e.g. on nos. 1/99-104). B.M. F 150 (no. 45) gives a spirited version 

of some nocturnal love-adventure, no doubt taken from a play, and bringing down 

to mortal level the scene on the Vatican krater (no. 175), which shows Zeus 

accompanied by Hermes on a similar pursuit. On the B.M. krater the lover, who 

does not wear a tunic over his jerkin, like the torch-bearer, and must therefore be 

deemed to be naked, is climbing up the ladder that leads up to the window in which 

the bust of his inamorata is visible; in his left hand is a crimson fillet, in his right a 

clutch of white eggs, which he offers her, with a highly expectant look. She can only 

be said to view his ardour with a certain absence of interest. We have already seen 

women framed in windows on Lipari 927 (no. 1/99); they appear, as we shall see, 

with some frequency on Paestan vases, and indeed elsewhere in South Italian, as 

Schauenburg has illustrated in his article in RM 79, 1972, pp. 1-15, with addenda in 

80, 1973, pp. 271-3. To the right stands a servant, who has lighten his master on his 

way with the blazing torch he holds in his left hand; there is a situla in his right. 

The draped youths on the reverses fall into varous groups�at first we have a 

combination of Type Al and A2 (nos. 34-9), then various combinations with Type 

A3, in which the himation is so draped as to produce a V- or U-shaped opening over 

the chest (nos. 40-7, 50-1), and finally with Type B, in which the torso is left exposed 

(nos. 52-65). The himatia in all cases have a plain black stripe as the border; the 

youths hold various objects (stick, egg, fillet, wreath, 'skewer of fruit'), and often 

wear wreaths round their heads (e.g. nos. 37-8, 41-5, 52-7, 60, 61, 63-5). The shape 

of no. 34 departs slightly from the norm, since the body of the krater has a 

pronounced convex curve as it approaches the stem; elsewhere the body assumes its 

more characteristic cylindrical form.

(a) Young satyr with thyrsus and fillet, Dionysos with thyrsus, drapery over 1. arm and

The object in the 1. hand of the servant on this vase, which reappears on many others in a similar 

context (e.g. nos. 174 and 177 by Asteas; nos. 257, 263, 266, 269, 271, 288, 296-7, 311 by Python) has 

sometimes been identified as a lantern rather than a situla�see S. Loeschke, 'Antike Lanternen und 

Lichthauschen', in BJbb 118, 1910, pp. 270 ff. and pi. 28, on which the B.M. vase is illustrated as fig. 4; 

also Wolfgang Radt, 'Lampen und Beleuchtung in der Antike', in Ant. Welt 17/1, 1986, pp. 40 ff, where 

the vase is illustrated (in an old and very bad drawing) on p. 42, fig. 6. Both here and on nos. 174 and 

177 the phlyax who carries it is also holding a blazing torch, which would render a lantern unnecessary. 

Further the sides of the vessel look to be solid and not, as might be expected, perforated or partly cut 

away to allow the emission of the light (as on Loeschke, pi. 28, 6 or pi. 29, 13), nor does it correspond 

with extant terracotta lanterns, especially in regard to the handle. 

Actual situlae, like the one here, are found in both Apulian and Campanian, but not as yet in 

Paestan (cf, however, no. 1/104). An Apulian example, very similar in shape to this one and having 

small feet attached to the base, may be seen in New York 56.171.64 by the Lycurgus Painter (Oliver, 

Bull. Metr. Mus., Summer 1962, pp. 25ff., fig. 1; RVAp I, p. 417, no. 17, pi. 150, 3-\; cf. also no. 17a). 

Situlae appear regularly on Apulian vases, sometimes with figured decoration, which would rule out 

the possibility of their being any form of lantern (e.g. RVAp II, pis. 335, 5; 384, 8); they are also 

frequently held by mourners at the tomb. For discussions of the shape see K. Schauenburg, Jdl 84, 

1969, pp. 35 ff. and RM 88, 1981, pp. 107 ff; ^^ 1981, pp. 462-488; Meded Rome 43, 1981, pp. 83-9; see 

also B. Schroeder, 74 BWPr, 1910.

Hydriai 

(a) With double palmette-fan below the handles and without detached framing palmettes 

The two hydriai in this sub-division are connected by both style and pattern-work. 

Below the back-handle is a large palmette-fan superposed on a smaller and squatter 

one, with a side-leaf or leaves, but without the usual scrolls or tendrils. In the field 

around are rosettes and phialai (cf. nos. 27 and 31, the latter also having an owl 

beneath the side-handles, as on no. 69 where, however, it appears only on the left 

side), and on no. 68 a typical framing palmette appears between the woman and 

youth in the main picture. Note the double curved scroll beside the left side-handle 

on no. 68, which is repeated on no. 71 and on other later vases.

(b) With detached framing palmettes beside the side-handles 

The hydriai in this sub-division all have a standard Paestan framing palmette (Type 

IV D) beside the side-handles. The Garcia hydria (no. 70) clearly marks the 

transition from the pattern-work on the vases in (i) to that in (ii); beside the left 

handle the detached palmette has a large hooked leaf descending from the central 

spiral, with a fan above it, the palmette on the right side is of the normal Type IV D. 

In front of the heads below the handles on this hydria there is a small detached scroll 

like that on nos. 20 and 21, providing a further connecting link with the vases in that 

group. Between the youth and woman in the main picture, who follow the 

conventional treatment for such pairs, is a small tendril-like plant, which terminates 

in what has been called the 'Asteas flower' (Fig. 4). No. 71 is a repetition of no. 70, 

with minor variations; nos. 70-72 have superposed fans below the back-handle (as 

also on nos. 73-9), and the picture runs up on to the shoulder. On nos. 73-8a the 

shoulder is flatter and decorated with laurel-pattern, meeting in a central rosette or 

flower. Nos. 73�6 form a very compact group, all depicting a male figure (Eros on 

nos. 75 and 77, Hermes on no. 76) bending forward in an almost identical pose (cf. 

also no. 65) in front of a seated woman wearing a peplos, with a piece of dot-stripe 

bordered drapery over the lower part of her body. On no. 77 an Eros leaning on a 

pillar replaces the figure bending forward. Nos. 78 and 78a are exceptional in this 

sub-division since each represents three figures, but are otherwise closely comparable 

with the rest. All have very similar female heads beneath the side-handles; the hair is 

caught up in a sphendone decorated with black dots, from which a large bunch of hair 

emerges over the ear and at the back. Sometimes there is a row of white beads as well 

(nos. 73-5, 78) and usually a black bead necklace (not on no. 71, nor the head to 

right on no. 70).

a flowering plant between the two figures comparable to that on no. 70, though here 

the flower is somewhat larger and the black centre less emphasised. The treatment of 

the different figures, the drapery and the heads below the handles corresponds with 

that on the other hydriai in this sub-division.

(ii) 28848 (10 x 7-5), part of draped woman seated on tendril, an altar, and a female

PAdd, no. A 30 (= NF 5) 
(i) Draped woman holding dish of eggs, 
(ii) nude youth, with drapery over left arm, beside a stele to 1. 

Hydria (of special shape) 

The following hydria (pi. 37) has been treated in a manner without close parallel on 

other South Italian vases. The body has been cut right round just above the handles 

and below the band of egg-pattern that runs beneath the laurel-wreath and flower 

on the shoulder, which is more strongly curved than on the other hydriai in this 

section. As a result, the upper part of the hydria has been transformed into a sort of 

lid, which, when removed, reveals that the interor has been divided into three 

compartments, one filling half the available space, the other two a quarter each. 

Each compartment has a lid decorated in red-figure against an outline of black, the 

rest of the area being left reserved in red; on one of the lids there is also a female head 

on the underside matching the one on the other. The lids are all perforated with two 

holes, probably to facilitate their removal. The use of a hydria for such a purpose 

seems to be unique, but for a vase of a different shape with internal compartments 

provided with decorated lids we may compare the lepaste in the Geddes coll. in 

Melbourne (P5:2, no. 3/1 below), associated with the Painter of Naples 1778. 

*86 London Market, McAlpine GR 466. Ht. 26. PLATE 37 
Body: nude youth, with drapery over upraised r. arm, holding mirror in 1. hand, kneeling 
beside a laver, above which is a waterspout, from which water is dripping down. 
Lids: (i) large�phlyax actor, holding crooked stick and wearing cloak over a white 
tunic; (ii) head of youth in profile to 1.; (iii) head of woman in profile to 1., with a similar head 
on the underside. 

The pattern-work consists of a large palmette-fan below the back-handle, with 

a triangular core, flanked on either side by one tall and one shorter scroll; below the 

side-handles is a detached framing palmette, with a fan above the central spiral and 

a drop-leaf below it; the picture itself is framed between two vertical reserved bands. 

The foot is in two degrees, with three reserved bands in relief for the stem; the outer 

edge of the upper element is also reserved. 

In style, the figures on the hydria seem to go most closely with those on other 

vases in this section, though the kneeling youth by the laver has better parallels 

among some of the later vases, as so far we have not seen figures in quite that posture 

(cf. no. 204 below). The phlyax, with his crooked stick, recalls those on Syracuse 

29966 and the situla fragment (nos. 1/103-4), but here he is younger, still with black 

hair; he has the characteristic high arched eyebrows of the Astean phlyakes (cf. nos. 

19, 26, 63-4) and the open mouth and pointed beard of the slave (Mask: Type B or 

'Something of a parallel to this may be seen in the silver ossuary hydria from the 'Prince's Tomb' 

at Vergina, illustrated by M. Andronicos in Vergina: The Royal Tombs (1984) on p. 214, according to 

whom it was 'specially constructed for use as a container of bones, since it was cut in half immediately 

below the shoulder so that the burnt bones might easily be placed inside. The two sections were held 

together by square hinges placed on the touching edges' (p. 212). The tomb is dated around 325 B.C. by 

Andronicos (p. 224). 

N), who will reappear on other later vases below (e.g. nos. 172-3, 177). Like so many 

of the slaves in phlyax plays he has a very cunning look and is obviously out to cheat 

someone. The treatment of the eyes, nose, lips and chin on the heads which adorn 

the lids of the two smaller compartments find parallels on those beneath the handles 

of the hydriai we have already looked at, but the hair is rendered somewhat 

differently. The youth has a leafy wreath round his head, the curly hair on top of 

which assumes the shape of a series of waves; the two women both wear stephanai 

with tall radiate spikes and have curly hair with a large bun at back. Only one wears 

a head-dress, but both have large pendant earrings. It would seem that greater care 

has been lavished on these two heads than those on the hydriai; it may well be that a 

vase of such remarkable shape was a very special order. 

Neck-amphorae 

The slender, ovoid body of the neck-amphora hardly lends itself to the use of framing 

palmettes, which would have to be unusually tall to fill the space available. On the 

five neck-amphorae below no frames are used at all, and the pictures simply stand 

between the large palmette-fans beneath the handles. The heads on the necks are 

sometimes set in a metope-like frame (e.g. on nos. 88 and 91) formed by reserved 

stripes around them; on no. 91, and to a lesser extent on no. 88, it will be noted that 

the panel is some way down on the neck, leaving an area in black-glaze immediately 

above it (cf. also nos. 353-4 and 357 below). The figured scenes on the obverses and 

the draped youths on the reverses merely repeat those we have already seen, just as 

the heads on the necks find close parallels with those on the various hydriai. We may 

note the inverted V drape on the youth to left on nos. 87-8 (cf. no. 53, and later nos. 

166 and 176). All the amphorae have laurel-wreaths on the shoulders; on the 

obverses these may meet in a central flower, as on many of the hydriai.

Pelikai 

Three pelikai find a place here, one (no. 92) without framing palmettes, the oth

two with them. Nos. 92-3 have superposed palmettes below the handles, no. 94 a 

single large fan. Again the treatment of the figures is very uniform; the only 

departure from the norm being the substitution of a seated draped youth on the 

reverse of no. 94 for the more canonical standing one. More emphasis now tends to 

be placed on the black borders of their himatia, which are a little thicker than before 

(cf. also nos. 87-8).

Lekanides 

Lastly in this group we may look at a few lekanides, with figured compositions o

their lids. They are all decorated in much the same manner; the bowl has a band of 

laurel at the top between the handles, and on nos. 95-6 there is a reserved stripe on 

the handle at the join; the knob is decorated with superposed palmette-fans in black-

figure, with a rosette on either side, and the lid with two- or three-figure compo 

sitions separated by varying types of palmette-scrolls, mostly of the simpler variety 

with a spiral and drop-leaf, although on no. 95 one of the leaves assumes a hooked 

form and on no. 96 there is one of the typical framing palmettes (IV D) as well. The 

figures, especially the young satyrs, are replicas of those on the bell-kraters and 

hydriai, and we may note the frequent appearance of a mirror with a large black 

disk in the centre, which has appeared several times on other vases (e.g. nos. 27, 31, 

75, 78 and 92).

Gabriella Prisco, A.I.O.N. 7, 1985, p. 139, no. 4, fig. 43, 1. 
(a) Eros with cista and fillet, (a) youth. 
The vase is known to me only from the illustration of the obverse in Prisco's article; she 
associates it with other vases from the workshop of Asteas and Python, and the Eros is very 
similar in treatment, especially in regard to the wings, to the one on no. 98; the ground-lines 
and dividing palmettes also correspond. The lid was found with a bowl (inv. 38129) but, 
according to Prisco, the two do not belong together. 

This section contains a number of vases of smaller dimensions which are associa

pattern-work and in style with those in the two preceding sections. Some of them are 

probably minor works by the painter himself, others seem to be workshop pieces. 

With the exception of three vases (nos. 101, 109 and 120) which have two-figure 

compositions, all the rest are decorated with single figures, mostly taken from the 

larger compositions on the vases in sections 1 and 2. Noteworthy is the frequent use 

of a broad, black stripe down the centre of women's garments, with another stripe in 

added white running down the middle, but without the dots on either side, which 

regularly appeared on similar drapery in the preceding sections. Many of the women 

on these vases wear a peplos with a girdle; there is a row of parallel vertical fold-lines 

on the lower part of the garment away from the bent leg (e.g. on nos. 101, 104, 107, 

114, 118, 120, 124); a somewhat similar arrangement of fold-lines, but here running 

diagonally across the drapery, will be seen on the running women on nos. 102, 

115-7, 119, 121-3. The heads on nos. 108, 112-3 should be compared with those on 

the hydriai in section 2; note also the laurel-branch on nos. 112, 118-120, as on nos. 

13 and 73; the owl below the handles of no. 120 recalls those on nos. 31 and 69. 

It should also be noted that nos. 102, 105-6 and 111 come from the same tomb 

(C. Arcioni, 1977, T. 271) as the larger hydria no. 11, which shows them to be 

contemporary, and probably the work of the same painter. Several of the vases in 

this section were placed in PPSupp in the general Asteas-Python Group (e.g. nos. 

101, 117, 119, 120 and 124) and two others (nos. 100 and 103) even later, but, in the 

light of all the new vases that have come to our knowledge since then, it will be seen 

that they are better placed in this comparatively early group.

Since the publication of PP, when six vases signed by Asteas were known, five more 

have come to light, two from excavations (no. 134 at Agropoli and no. 131 at 

Buccino); the other three are of uncertain provenience and have found their way to 

America via the international market, though there is a strong probability that at 

least nos. 128 and 133 came originally from Paestum or nearby. This raises the total 

of signed vases to eleven and thus enables us to get a much better picture of the 

stylistic development of Paestum's most important vase-painter and to associate with 

him a greater number of vases than was previously possible. 

All the vases are signed 'AacrTeaS eypo^e; the signature, normally incised (nos. 

127, 129 and 134-5) or painted in added white (nos. 125-6, 130, 132-3), and once in 

diluted black glaze (no. 128), varies in its location on the vase; it usually appears on 

the band of decorative pattern-work either above the main scene or else below it. A 

list of the signed vases is given below, but, in view of their special significance, a more 

detailed discussion of each of them (except no. 131) follows.

The Berlin Phlyax Krater (no. 125; PI. 44) 

The old repainting has now been removed from this vase, and this has left its re

in a somewhat damaged condition, with a number of details (notably the upper part 

of the satyr's head) now missing. However, from the rendering of Dionysos, and from 

what remains of the face of the young satyr, for both of which good parallels can be 

found on the vases in Chapter IV, as well as from the palmette-scrolls in the centre 

and on either side of the picture, which are comparable to those on nos. 20-1, 70, 75, 

95-7 above, this vase would seem to date from a fairly early stage in the career of 

Asteas, probably around 350 B.C. It was the subject of a detailed study by Robert 

Zahn in FR iii, pp. 178-207, with further observations in Die Antike 7, 1931, pp. 70 ff. 

The handle-zone on the obverse is decorated with palmettes and scroll-work in 

added white, on the reverse with three meanders on either side of a chequered 

square, another link with the earlier vases. 

The design offers no difficulty in the way of interpretation; two rogues have 

conspired to rob a miser, who, resisting desperately to the last, has finally hurled 

himself upon the chest containing the money the robbers wish to steal. His servant 

stands gibbering on the right, unable to lift a finger to help his master. Above the 

chest hang two female masks (Type S, one of which is now barely visible) and a 

wreath, perhaps an indication that the play was a prize-winner. The scene has also 

been interpreted as a parody of the myth of Procrustes, but the chest does not look 

like a bed, and the whole scene is clearly taking place out of doors, so the simpler 

explanation seems the better one. 

The chief robber is rYMNIAOX, a name which probably has some connection 

with YuuvnAoi, glossed by Hesychius as oi TrevfJTes. His comrade in 

crime is KQ2IAOZ, rightly taken by Zahn as the equivalent of the 

chatterbox. The old man is XAPINOS, a name familiar to us from Latin comedy;

possibly some hint of the word X<*P is intended, as being particularly inappropriate 

for a miser, and so producing a comic touch. The slave is KAPIQN, another common 

slave name and one, like Sikon, suggested by his origin. The names of TuuviAos and 

KcocnAos are barely legible, but the restorations are fairly certain. 

That we have on this vase a scene inspired by the actual performance of a 

phlyax play, there can be little doubt, since the story is represented as if it were being 

acted before our eyes. The stage looks back to that on Lipari 927 (no. 1/99), but here 

the supporting columns are somewhat higher (cf. B.M. F 189, no. 280) and there is 

no curtain in front of them. Three basic forms of stage appear on phlyax vases, apart 

from just a suggestion of a low platform; Type I, with a low stage supported by posts; 

Type II, in which the posts are replaced by columns; and Type III, with a more 

elaborate stage, with taller supports, sometimes approached by a flight of steps.

Such types of stage point to an impromptu kind of performance, in which light, 

movable sets could be used to indicate the relevant background�temple, house or 

street. That these performances took place in the open is suggested by the phlyax 

krater in a private collection in Bari, in which the curtain in front of the supporting 

columns of the stage is attached at one point to the trunk of a growing tree, which 

serves as a place of concealment for a flute-player, who makes the actual music while 

two phlyakes prance round an altar pretending to play the flute. 

The provenience of the Berlin vase is less certain than that of most of the others; 

it was in the possession of the Bishop of Nola and passed later to the Berlin Museum. 

It seems to have been found at S. Agata dei Goti, though it does not appear in the 

lists of such vases published in Documenti Inediti, but these are mainly concerned with 

the vases which went to Naples. 

The Phrixos Krater in Naples (no. 126; PI. 45) 

This vase was found in Paestum in 1858, but the details of its discovery are not given 

in the contemporary publications (Bull.Arch.Nap. n.s. vii, 1859, pp. 36 ff. and 64, 

pi. 3; Arch.Anz. 1859, pp. 91-2). It is in very poor condition with a badly worn 

surface; most of the head of Phrixos on the obverse, and a good deal of the upper left-

hand side of the reverse are now missing. The shape is similar to that of the Berlin 

krater, though the body is rather taller; the decoration on the handle-zones also 

corresponds, with the addition of a band of wave-pattern below the meanders on the 

reverse. 

 Cf. the Andria of Terence and the Pseudolus of Plautus. 

Kocpicov occurs in the Synephebi of Euphron (frag. 10) and in the Plutus of Aristophanes. Also in the 

Headlam on Herodas i, 1. 

For the various types of phlyax stage see PhV, p. 13, and for Asteas, in particular, S. Gogos in 

OJh 54, 1983, pp. 59-70. 

RVAp I, p. 400, no. 15/28, pi. 140,5; F. G. La Porto in Studies Trendall (1979), pp. 107-110, pi. 29. 

The myth of Phrixos and Helle is not very often represented in South Italian 

vase-painting; Phrixos, by himself, riding over the sea on the back of the ram or else 

about to sacrifice the animal after his safe arrival in Colchis, appears on several 

vases, but this one is unique in showing brother and sister together upon it. Later 

marble reliefs or Pompeian paintings show Helle after she has fallen off the back of 

the ram and is disappearing into the sea.

The Asteas vase shows Phrixos and Helle (.. AH) seated on the ram�the fleece 

of which was originally resplendent in white and gold, of which only the faintest 

traces now remain�flying over the sea, represented pictorially by a Triton, a Scylla, 

a sea monster and seven small fish (cf. no. 129). In the top left-hand corner is 

Nephele (NEOE..), who spreads out her cloud-like mantle as if to shield her 

children; while in the other corner is Dionysos (... OZ) riding on a panther, with an 

old silen behind him. Hyginus (Fab. 3) gives a slight variation of the usual version of 

the myth, and says that it was while Phrixos and Helle were wandering about in a 

wood under a spell of madness inflicted by Dionysos that their mother rescued them 

and sent them off to Colchis on the golden-fleeced ram. This will perhaps explain the 

otherwise rather incongruous appearance of Dionysos in the scene. 

The composition on the reverse is arranged on two levels�on the lower one, 

Dionysos moves forward with outstretched arms between a maenad in a similar pose 

and a bearded silen, who brandishes a torch; above, is a row of busts, seen behind an 

undulating white ground-line. The drapery has the typical dot-stripe border, with a 

dot-stripe also running down the centre of the running maenad's drapery and down 

what is visible of that of the maenad above. 

One feature is noteworthy: the entire omission of anything in the way of a frame 

on either side of the vase. 

On representations of Phrixos see Roscher, ML iii, 2463; Jacobsthal, Die Melischen Reliefs, 

pp. 186 ff.; De la Coste-Messeliere, Au Musee de Delphes, pp. 168 ff.; K. Schauenburg, 'Phrixos', in RMPh 

101, 1958, pp. 41-50. See also the entry under Elle in EAA iii, pp. 313-4 and the article by K. Stahler 

'Die Phrixosschussel in Munster', in Boreas 3, 1980, pp. 137-156, with illustrations of the two Phrixos 

dishes on pi. 15. Lists of vases depicting Phrixos are given by Brommer in VD, pp. 502-3; to those 

showing the sacrifice of the ram (D 1�4 and 10) may now be added a volute-krater in Berlin by the 

Darius Painter (1984.41; Berliner Museen 1/85, ill. on p. 8). 

The woman with a nimbus round her head riding on a ram depicted on an early Lucanian bell-

krater by the Arno Painter (Taranto 127915; LCS, p. 689, no. 297 a; Suppl. Ill, p. 20; BdA 52, 1967, 

p. 258, fig. 60) is more likely to be Theophane, with Poseidon in the guise of a ram, than Helle. 

E.g. (1) slab from marble sarcophagus from the Palatine�Robert, Ant. Sark. Rel., ii, 187, pi. 61, 

(2) and (3) two wall-paintings from Pompeii in Naples�8889 and 8896, Elia, Cat., nos. 148-9, (4) a 

mosaic from Pompeii in Naples, inv. 10005, AdI, 1867, pi. A; Sear, Roman Wall and Vault Mosaics (RM, 

Erghft. 23, 1977), p. 86, pi. 33,1, and p. 187. 

Further references to Pompeian paintings will be found s.v. Phrixos in the index to K. Schefold, 

Die Wande Pompejis (Berlin, 1957). 

'These were painted on in white, which has now flaked off. One was being speared by Scylla, three 

are in the curves of her tail and body, one below the Triton, one between him and Scylla, and the other 

beneath the monster. The fish serve primarily to indicate the presence of the sea over which the ram is 

flying (as on no. 129), and there is no reason to suppose, with Amelung, that the monsters represent 

powers of evil. On Scylla see Jacobsthal, op cit., pp. 190 ff. and Schauenburg in RM 87, 1980, pp. 29 ff. 

The canine element of Scylla is interesting and one should not forget that the Italian for shark is 

pescecane, and that the promontory of Scilla is still well-known for its sharks, which in ancient times 

might have devoured the victims of Charybdis opposite. 

The Madness of Herakles Krater in Madrid (no. 127; Pis. 46-7) 

This vase was found at Paestum in 1864 as the result of excavations sponsored by the 

Marquis of Salamanca, to whose collection reference has already been made. The 

varnishing on the surface of the vase referred to in PP has now been largely removed 

and the vase properly cleaned. The shape and pattern-work correspond closely with 

that of the Phrixos krater, as does the composition of the scene on the reverse. 

The madness of Herakles is well attested in literature, but this is the only 

representation of it extant in South Italian vase-painting. In the centre, a 

dominating figure, stands Herakles (NPAKAHZ), dressed in an almost transparent 

short chiton, with a chlamys flapping out behind his back, and wearing on his head a 

crested helmet from which two tall feathers rise upward�an indication of Samnite 

influence, since such feathers regularly appear on the helmets of Samnite warriors.

He holds in his arms the body of his small son, who vainly appeals for mercy by 

clutching at his father's beard. But there is no escape from the blazing pile of 

household furniture which is waiting for him, and his horrified mother, Megara 

(MEFAPH), moves off through the open door on the right, tearing her hair and 

beating her breast in the conventional manner of mourners. From the loggia above 

Alkmene (AAKMHNH) and Iolaus (IOAHOZ) look down in protest, the one with her 

hand at her breast, the other with it raised in a gesture of disapproval. In the left 

corner is the personification of Madness (MANIA), holding a whip. Immediately 

below the picture is the artist's signature, eypo^e, the letters being incised. 

The meaning is clear; the full interpretation less so, for the story here depicted 

does not correspond exactly with any of the surviving legends of the madness of 

Herakles, especially that used by Euripides. In the Euripidean version there are 

three children; one is slain with a club, and the other two, together with their mother 

Megara, by arrows; nor do Alkmene and Iolaus appear. The story of the burning of 

the children may be traced to Pherecydes, but this version does not appear in any 

of the tragedies of which we have records. 

The scene here represented, therefore, would appear to have no direct connec 

tion with the Euripidean tragedy, and Bieber, who is followed by Zahn, may be right 

in associating it with neither tragedy nor comedy, but with something more akin to a 

"The literary references are given in Brommer, Herakles II (Darmstadt, 1984), pp. 21-2. Megara 

with a couple of the children of Herakles, shown wearing bandages, appears on a number of kraters

hilaro-tragedy of the kind later written by Rhinthon, in the third century B.C.

That the structure which forms the background to the scene has some connection 

with the stage seems highly probable, especially in view of the very similar one which 

appears on the hydria signed by Asteas (Paestum 20202; no. 134), which may well 

have been inspired by the Stheneboia of Euripides. Indeed, Bulle went so far as to 

call it the 'Asteas-stage' (Asteasbiihne) and the problem has been recently discussed in 

some detail by Savas Gogos. On the vase the structure has a ceiling supported in 

front by two tall Ionic columns, while four shorter Doric columns, rising from a sort 

of loggia well above the level of the stage floor, support it at the back. Parallels have 

often been drawn between it and the building depicted on the Santangelo terracotta 

in Naples, but it now seems that this is more likely to represent a town-gate, in view 

of the evidence put forward by Lidiano Bacchielli. The background to the scene on 

the vase seems to me to be definitely of stage inspiration, and it looks as if the action 

is taking place outside the house itself. 

The reverse represents a Dionysiac scene composed in much the same way as 

that on the preceding vase, with the figures disposed on two levels, full size below 

and busts above. In the centre is Dionysos, the lower part of his body covered by the 

usual piece of drapery with a dot-stripe border, riding a panther; he is preceded by a 

bearded silen, whose head and body are shown in almost frontal view, and who 

holds a torch in one hand and a wreath in the other. Behind Dionysos is a maenad, 

wearing a peplos with overfall and a fawn-skin draped across it. Above are the busts 

of three maenads and a silen, each holding various objects, including a small bell. 

The scene reminds us of that on Louvre K240 (no. 1/94), which also showed 

Dionysos riding on a panther. 

There is a good deal of added colour on the obverse, where much use is made of 

purple-red and pink. The scroll-work on the obverse handle-zone has an "Asteas 

flower" at each end.

been put to periods ranging from the later fourth century B.C. to the early Roman Empire. Bacchielli 

(p. 31) puts it to the second or first century B.C.; this is perhaps a little late in view of the resemblance 

between the colours upon it and those on Canosan vases and terracottas of the early Hellenistic period.

"This krater is said to have come from a large tomb-group which also included the Orestes 

amphora (no. 133), the skyphos no. 138 below, the Cadmus lekanis (no. 141), the Jason lekythos in 

Bochum (no. 142), a stemless cup with a phlyax scene (no. 222), a kylix with four figures in the tondo 

(no. 220), a hydria (no. 73), a large oenochoe, and various smaller vases. Many of these are illustrated 

in Sonderliste U of Munzen und Medaillen (Nov. 1984), pp. 25 ff., but they have now been widely 

kraters, except that the foot has now become taller and is treated more elaborately, 

to give almost the effect of a stand. There is an overhanging lip at the join of the body 

and the foot, and below this the stem curves gently outwards to a flat base in two 

degrees. It anticipates the still more elaborate foot we shall see on the Europa krater 

in Malibu (no. 129), which has figured decoration; here there are only reserved 

bands at the join and on the lip and on the upper edge of the base. The vase has been 

recomposed from numerous fragments, and there are quite substantial pieces missing 

(notably, the back of Agamemnon's head and the upper part of Clytemnestra's 

body); there is a good deal of retouching, especially at the joins on the reverse where, 

however, apart from the face of Dionysos, it does not greatly affect the figures. 

The obverse represents the well-known story of Telephos and the infant 

Orestes. Telephos, the son of Herakles and Auge, became king of Mysia and, when 

the Greeks landed there in their first unsuccessful attempt to get to Troy, he fought 

against them; because of his neglect of Dionysos he caught his foot in a vine which 

sprang forth unexpectedly from the ground, tripped, and was wounded in the thigh 

by Achilles with his spear. The wound refused to heal and an oracle of Apollo 

proclaimed that it could be cured only by the weapon which had caused it. Telephos 

then went to Argos in Greece where he found the Greeks assembling for another 

attempt on Troy. There he seized the infant Orestes and threatened to kill him unless 

Agamemnon would persuade Achilles to heal him. As Agamemnon had been 

warned that the Greeks could not take Troy without the help of Telephos, he 

undertook to ask Achilles to heal him, provided he would guide the fleet to Troy, and 

this Achilles did by applying rust from his spear to the wound. 

The obverse of the San Antonio krater gives a very vivid picture of the scene 

where Telephos is threatening the life of the child Orestes. In the centre is a large 

altar in added white, with a triglyph frieze on the front, and a three-stepped base, on 

the lowest step of which is the inscription in glaze paint 'AaaTeas eypacpe. On the 

altar Telephos (THAEcDOZ) is kneeling with his left leg, while his right leg, the 

bandage round the wounded thigh clearly visible, stretches stiffly down in front of it. 

He wears a pilos on his head, a short embroidered tunic, with a thick black girdle, 

and high laced boots; in his right hand he held a sword (in added white, now 

vanished) and with his left grasps the small Orestes, who holds out both hands in a 

gesture of entreaty towards his mother Clytemnestra (KAVTAIMHZ...) who moves 

off to right, with her right arm upraised in a gesture of horror. She wears a polos, a 

long robe, with a piece of drapery, embroidered with stars and having a chequer-

patterned border, across the lower half of her body. From the left Agamemnon 

(ArAMEM.QN) comes up, a drawn sword in his right hand. He wears a short 

embroidered chiton, with a chequer border to the lower hem and a double ray-

pattern at the waist. Behind the altar is a column with an Ionic capital, on top of 

which there was originally a tripod in added white. This is perhaps to signify that the 

events are taking place in the sanctuary of Lycian Apollo. 

On the upper level four half-length figures look down upon the scene below; to 

left is the white-haired seer Calchas (KAAXAZ), then Apollo (.TTOAAQN), seated 

The fullest illustrated account of the legend will be found in Christa Bauchhenss-Thuriedl, Der 

Mythos von Telephos in der antiken Kunst (Wurzburg, 1971), with a list of the representations of the 

Telephos-Orestes episode on pp. 87-90. A list of those on South Italian and Etruscan vases is also given 

by Brommer in VL, p. 472, with additions by K. Schauenburg in 'Zur Telephossage in Unteritalien', in 

RM 90, 1983, pp. 339-358, where the San Antonio krater is illustrated on pi. 84,1 and referred to on p. 

347. See also IGD, pp. 103^4, III.3, 47-9 for connections with the Telephos of Euripides, and Webster, 

and half-draped, with a laurel-branch in his left hand, then Hermes (EPMHZ) with 

the kerykeion, and finally a woman, whose right hand clutches her hair, as if in a 

gesture of mourning or sorrow; she is inscribed 0PIZA, but what this signifies is 

doubtful and the suggestion, made in Sonderliste U, p. 28, that it stands for 0PAIZZA 

(Thracian), is ingenious and, if correct, would indicate that she was probably the 

Thracian nursemaid of Orestes, since Thracians frequently served in that capacity. 

It might, however, stand for some local personification, as on other vases by Asteas 

(e.g. nos. 132, 141). Much of the added white used for the inscriptions has now 

disappeared and some of the letters are almost indecipherable. 

The reverse shows a typical Dionysiac scene, as on the two preceding kraters, 

with Dionysos on the lower level flanked by a silen and a maenad, and four half-

length figures above, a youth, two maenads and a silen. Here Dionysos bends 

forward over his raised right foot to converse with the silen, the maenad stands by 

with a thyrsus in her hands. Counterparts to all three may be seen on the vases in 

Chapter IV. Between the silen and Dionysos is a simple palrnette-scroll (as on no. 

125), and between him and the maenad a 'framing' palmatte with an 'Asteas flower' 

at the top (cf. no. 70). In shape and style the vase seems to show a slight development 

from nos. 125-7 and is probably to be dated to c. 340 B.C. 

The Europa Krater in Malibu (no. 129; Pis. 49-51 a) 

This is the largest and perhaps the most impressive of all the vases signed by Asteas, 

remarkable for the height of its foot (21 cm.), which represents a more elaborate and 

decorated version of that of the preceding krater, and which serves almost as a stand 

for the vase. The overhanging lip at the junction of the body of the vase with the 

stem of the foot is decorated with tongue-pattern; below it, where the stem curves 

outward to meet the top of the actual foot, is a frieze of two horses pursued by two 

griffins, all running to left, and on the lowest section of the foot is a band of ivy, with 

incised stems and rosette-like flowers in added white, similar to that below the rim. 

Closely associated in style with the foot of the Malibu krater is the foot of 

another such calyx-krater, the body of which has not been found. It was recently on 

the Swiss market, having been earlier on the market in Los Angeles, and must be the 

work of the same painter.

Round the foot: ivy with incised stems and white rosette flowers. 

The Scylla and Triton may be compared with their counterparts on the Getty 

krater; they are even closer to those on Naples 3412. Also comparable is the calyx-

krater fragment Malibu 76 AE 99, 1, which shows part of a bull in added white, the 

back part of Scylla, and a fish; the treatment of the subject must have been similar to 

that on the Asteas krater, although here the style is quite different, and it suggests 

that both may have been inspired by some common source; possibly a lost painting. 

This vase has recently been published in detail by Marit Jentoft-Nilsen in Greek Vases in the 

J. Paul Getty Museum (Occasional Papers on Antiquities, 1, 1983), pp. 139-148. I am deeply grateful to her 

for discussing the vase with me at length in the Museum and for supplying me with excellent photos of 

it. In view of the full description given in her article, my comments on it here are comparatively brief. 

The subject of the obverse is Europa on the bull, a theme popular with Greek 

painters, but so far this is its only representation in Paestan. It is painted in a 

unique pentagonal panel, formed by cutting off the two top corners of the normal 

rectangle to transform them into triangular spaces. A somewhat similar scheme, on a 

much smaller scale, and without figures inside the triangles will be found on other 

Paestan vases, especially lebetes gamikoi. In the centre of the main panel is Europa 

(EVPQTTH) seated on the back of a white bull, whose left horn she gently grasps. They 

fly to the left over the sea, which is represented by a Scylla (ZKYAA), grasping a 

trident, a Triton (TPITQN) with an oar (cf. no. 126), and a large number of small 

fish and marine creatures. Both Scylla and Triton shade their eyes from the awesome 

spectacle. Flying above Europa on the bull is a small nude winged figure, with a 

reddish-brown piece of drapery across the back of his thighs and over his left 

forearm. One would normally have identified him as Eros but an inscription tells us 

he is Pothos (TTOQOZ), perhaps more appropriate in this context than Eros, as 

personifying passion. In the triangular panel at the top left are three figures 

identified by their inscriptions as Zeus (ZEYZ), Krete (KPHTH) and Hermes 

(r-PMHZ), in diminishing size from left to right. Zeus is half-draped in an em 

broidered cloak with a chequer border, and carries a sceptre; Krete, personifying the 

land to which Europa is being carried, wears a red kekryphalos on her head and an 

embroidered chiton and cloak; Hermes holds his kerykeion in his right hand, and 

wears a chlamys fastened at the neck. The corresponding panel on the right shows 

the figures increasing in size from left to right; first a small Eros, shown in added 

white, then a half-length Adonis (AAONIZ), with slightly more of Aphrodite 

(AOPOAITH), whose hand rests upon his left shoulder. Her flesh is painted white and 

she wears embroidered drapery, like that of Adonis. The general symmetry of the 

composition as a whole is thoroughly in keeping with the normal practice of the 

painter, as exemplified on several of his other vases. 

The decoration of the reverse follows his usual formula, but here the busts in the 

upper level are formally separated from the lower level by a reserved band below 

them, dividing the framed rectangle into a smaller band and a larger panel. In the 

centre is Dionysos, holding a thyrsus in his right hand and a couple of eggs in his left, 

flanked by a maenad, with a wreath and a torch, and a silen with a thyrsus and a 

phiale: again all are taken from the artist's stock repertory. Above is a row of five 

half-figures; a maenad with a bell in one hand, another with a torch, a papposilen 

with a tambourine, a maenad with a thyrsus and Pan. All three maenads, like the 

full-length one below and the papposilen, have a fawn-skin draped diagonally across 

their body and over the left shoulder. 

Below the main scene on the obverse, between two reserved stripes, runs a band 

of alternating black and reserved rectangles (possibly a substitute for dentils), as on 

various Sicilian kraters; it may be a reminiscence of a stage floor, but here it serves 

little other than a decorative purpose (cf. the neck of no. 133). The floral pattern on 

the handle-zone takes the usual form and is painted in white; on the reverse a new 

pattern appears, consisting of an ivy-wreath with small leaves and dot-cluster flowers 

in added white, with a central flower. 

Noteworthy is the very careful rendering of the hair, often shown in low relief, 

The subject is treated exhaustively by Eva Zahn, Europa und der Stier (Wurzburg, 1983), in which 

the Getty krater is no. 66, on p. 122. See also Brommer, VD, pp. 515-7; A. B. Cook, Zeus iii, pp. 615 ff.; 

Schauenburg in AuA 10, 1961, p. 88; Adriana Calinescu in VMG, pp. 156-8. 

with long, curling locks. The drawing of the faces is perhaps rather more careful than 

usual, and gives the impression that Asteas took a good deal of trouble over this 

particular vase. 

The Villa Giulia Phlyax Fragment (no. 130; PI. 54 6) 

Three fragments of this vase survive�a substantial portion of the obverse, together 

with a small section of the top of the reverse; the foot, which is 13-5 cm. in height, and 

somewhat similar to that of the Telephos krater; a very small piece of the reverse 

(c. 13 x 11) representing the lower part of the legs of a papposilen and a part of the 

meander band on the handle-zone. The vase was originally published by Gabrici in 

1910 and by Rizzo in 1925; the latter's incorrect restoration of the vase was accepted 

by Giglioli for publication in the CVA.

The fragments were found at Buccino, the ancient Volcei, not very far from 

Paestum; in the first instance they were lodged with the Museum of Naples, which 

for some reason did not acquire them, and later found their way back into the 

possession of a relative of the man on whose property they had been found. 

Subsequently they were purchased, mainly through the good offices of Prof. Rizzo, 

for the Museo Teatrale of the Scala Theatre at Milan, and from there they passed in 

1924 to the Villa Giulia in Rome, where they now are. 

The subject of the obverse is the Rape of Ajax, a clever parody of that stock 

theme, the Rape of Cassandra. It was a bold stroke so to transpose the roles, but the 

result is entirely successful. The Palladion raises an eyebrow (see Moret, Illioupersis, 

p. 15), and the priestess a hand, in amazement at what is taking place. Ajax, for all 

his armour, has run to the Palladion for help, and clasps it in a frenzy of terror; 

Cassandra grasps his helmet firmly with her left hand, presses her foot into the small 

of his back and raises her right hand to deal him a rousing blow. It is a splendid 

scene�the figures are wonderfully vivid and the contrast of expressions is admirably 

portrayed. The drawing both of figures and drapery is excellent. Cassandra 

(..ZZANAPH) wears a short-sleeved chiton, and has her hair done up above the 

forehead into a most curious bunch, tied round with a white fillet. Ajax wears a 

helmet similar to that worn by Herakles on the Madrid krater, but without the 

plumes. He has a very aquiline nose, and large teeth, well visible in his gaping 

mouth. His rather shaggy beard and moustache find a counterpart in the bust of Pan 

on the Hesperides lekythos. Like Athena on the Cadmus krater, he wears a corselet 

over a short-sleeved chiton. The Palladion has a similar helmet, and a very stiff, 

archaic-looking Doric costume, shaded in orange with a dotted purple stripe down 

the centre. It stands upon a pedestal coloured yellow with orange shading. The old 

"Gabrici, 'Frammento inedito di un vaso di Asteas', in Ausonia 5, 1910, pp. 56�68; Rizzo, 'Nuovi 

studi sul cratere di Buccino' in RM 40, 1925, pp. 217-239; Giglioli, CVA 3, IV Gr, pi. 2. Rizzo's 

restoration of the scene on the obverse as taking place on a stage similar to that on the Berlin krater 

(no. 125) fails to take into account the relationship between the height and diameter of calyx-kraters at 

this period. If the diameter is c. 34 cm., as reconstructed from the main fragment, then the height would 

be unlikely to exceed 36 or 37 cm., which, seeing that the actual height of the fragment combined with 

that of the foot comes to c. 30 cm., would hardly leave enough space to complete the figures and insert a 

stage as well (unless it was very much lower than that suggested by Rizzo). 

That the subject is not the theft of the Palladion was shown by Gabrici, op. cit., p. 61; on Ajax 

and Cassandra see, in particular, Davreux, Cassandre (1942), pp. 138-211; Moret, L'llioupersis dans la 

ceramique italiote (1975), pp. 11 ff. The Villa Giulia fragment is no. 15 in the latter's list on p. 11 and 

discussed on p. 15. 

priestess (IHPHA) wears a flowing chiton with a dot-stripe border to the overfold and 

a shawl bunched up round her neck. The folds are pictorially rendered with bold 

strokes (cf. the maenad on the reverse of the Europa krater), as are the wrinkles on 

her withered face. She is far from beautiful�a most protruding lower lip, three 

visible teeth and a shock of unkempt white hair are her most striking features. In her 

left hand she carries a huge temple key; her right is raised in a gesture of surprise. 

The whole picture is framed between two reserved bands with a small white cap on 

top, meant, as on the Cadmus krater, to suggest a column. Asteas has signed it with a 

painted inscription (AZZTEAZ EI~PA0E) above the head of the Palladion�the other 

inscriptions are all incised. 

On the reverse there was evidently a Dionysiac scene; all that remains are the 

feet of a papposilen, and a piece of the fawn-skin he was wearing. On the main 

fragment is a hanging wreath and a piece of a white fillet, probably attached to the 

thyrsus carried by the silen. Old silens occasionally figure on the vases of Asteas, and 

there are busts of them on the Europa, Cadmus and Phrixos kraters. We may 

conclude that there was a scene on this vase akin to the one on the Berlin vase; there 

cannot have been a row of busts, or some trace of them would have remained on the 

main fragment. 

In style this vase belongs to the period when the genius of Asteas was at its best. 

It breathes originality, and is entirely without the heaviness of his earlier work or the 

stereotyped repetitions we shall find in his later. The drawing gives a particular 

impression of clarity, enhanced by the bright pink of the fired clay which contrasts 

well with the black around it. It should probably be dated not long after 350 B.C. 

The Cadmus Bell-krater in Naples (no. 132; PI. 52) 

Heydemann gives the provenience of this vase as Bari, which would be unlikely, and 

in so doing was followed by Hoppin and others; Hirzel in 1864 (AdI, p. 336) labelled 

it as uncertain, but quoted Schulz (Amazonenvase, p. 14) as casting doubt upon that of 

Bari, which by then had become generally accepted. It was, in fact, found at 

S. Agata, and it appears as no. 53 in a catalogue of the vases unearthed there and in 

the possession of the Nuovo Museo at Naples in 1796; later on, in 1805, it is listed as no. 

42 in the catalogue of the Museo di Vecchi Studi (Doc. Ined. iv, p. 239). 

The fight between Cadmus and the serpent which guarded the spring at Thebes 

is a comparatively rare subject on South Italian vases, though a number of new 

examples have turned up in recent years.

Our vase shows the fight in full swing, with Cadmus (KAAMOZ) raising a stone 

in his right hand to deal the coup de grace to the large serpent which is coiled, ready to 

strike, below an overhanging rock above the spring, round which grow some shrubs 

and smaller plants. Beside Cadmus stands Athena, with helmet and spear; she wears 

"The ancient sources for the Cadmus legend are quoted in the articles by Crusius in ML ii, 

824-913 and Latte in REx, 2, 460-474. See also F. Vian, Les Origines de Thebes (Paris, 1963) and Ruth 

B. Edwards, Kadmos the Phoenician (Amsterdam, 1979), esp. Chapter II, pp. 31-2. Lists of South Italian 

vases illustrating Cadmus and the serpent will be found in Vian, pp. 35 ff., nos. 16-17, 19-20 and in 

Brommer, VI?, p. 480, nos. D2-6. A detailed study of the Campanian hydria in Boston (69.1142; 

Brommer D6) is given by Emily Vermeule in Studies Hanfmann (Mainz, 1971), pp. 177-188, pis. 46-9, 

with references (note 2) to other representations. Another Campanian hydria in a private collection in 

Naples with the same subject is published and discussed by Trendall in NAC 12, 1983, pp. 94�102, figs. 

5-7. A fuller version of the story appears on the lid of a lekanis attributed to Asteas, now in the 

Antikenmuseum in Basel (see below no. 141). 

a sleeved chiton and over it the aegis; the gorgoneion is concealed by her arm. The 

figures on the upper register serve to define the scene of action; to the left is the bust 

of the river god Ismenos (1MHNOZ), then comes the fountain-nymph Krenaia 

(KPHNAIH), and lastly, seated with her arm against the rock, is Thebe (0HBH) 

herself. Between Ismenos and Krenaia is a half sun's disk, a popular device with 

Paestan artists, which serves the combined purpose of indicating the time of day and 

filling up an otherwise empty space. Ismenos was the name of the river that flowed to 

the east of Thebes, the 'lo-unvoO OScop which Theseus (Euripides, Suppl. 383) directs 

his herald to cross in order to reach the city. Hofer (ML, ii 1412) took Krenaia to be 

the personification of the KprjvocTai lluAai, but this seems an unnecessary complic 

ation, as she is surely no more than the nymph of the spring (Kpr)vr\), of which the 

serpent was the guardian. The early artist drew in the whole well-house; Asteas has 

merely suggested the presence of the spring by the pitcher, the rock and the plants 

growing beside it, and, most important of all, by putting in the nymph herself. 

Pausanias (ix, 10, 5) says that the fountain was sacred to Ares, who placed the 

serpent there to guard it, and it seems to have been called Melia in antiquity, after a 

nymph by whom Apollo had two sons. Euripides (Phoen. 931 ff.), however, makes the 

serpent-guarded spring that of Dirke, which flows into the similarly named stream 

near by, for when Menoeceus sacrifices himself by cutting his throat on the 

battlements of Thebes, he falls down into the cave where the guardian serpent lives. 

On the reverse is another Dionysiac scene comparable to those on nos. 126-8, 

and following the same general scheme, but with only three busts in the upper 

register, the fourth being replaced by a palmette-fan in added white above the head 

of Dionysos. The side of the vase has unfortunately suffered a good deal at the hands 

of the restorer, especially in the upper level and on the silen to right. We may note 

the presence of a duck by Dionysos; it will reappear on many later vases. The 

pictures on both sides are framed between plain reserved bands; on the obverse there 

is a white cross-piece at the top, suggestive of a column-capital as on nos. 125 and 

127. 

The drapery is again heavy and elaborate. Beneath the rather awkward-

looking helmet of Athena appears in pale purple the cloth pad used to prevent the 

head from being chafed; it has a border of small white dots�a device popular with 

Paestan artists in conjunction with purple draperies of any sort. Round her lower 

limbs is draped a himation with a chequered border, like that of Clytemnestra on no. 

128. Her feet are apparently crossed, but the folds of the drapery have again gone 

astray, and the effect is wholly artificial. Cadmus wears a white pilos, and a chlamys 

hangs rather solidly down his back. The most elaborate drapery is reserved for 

Thebe, who wears a polos with a veil, an embroidered chiton with a palmette border 

and a himation bordered with wave-pattern. Her shoe, coloured with thinned glaze, 

is curiously pointed, and seems almost to be one with her drapery. On the reverse the 

decorations are much simpler, and confined to the usual dot-stripe. 

The Orestes Neck-amphora in San Antonio (no. 133; PI. 53) 

Like the Telephos krater, this vase has also been recomposed from fragments, with 

some pieces (notably in the area to left of Orestes and to right of the priestess) 

missing; the surface is badly worn on the left side of the obverse and the two figures 

On Ismenos see Carina Weiss, Gr. Flussgottheiten, pp. 141 and 167; no. F3 in the catalogue on 

p. 168. It is interesting to note that on the Cadmus lekanis (no. 141 below) the figure is female�Ismene. 

there are in very poor condition. The upper part of the amphora (mouth, neck and 

shoulder) and the foot are in better condition. The inscriptions which identify most 

of the figures on the obverse were in added white and have largely disappeared, 

though leaving still legible traces of the letters. The signature (AZZ PA<t>E), of 

which the middle letters are now lost, is on the base in front of the column. 

The shape is most unusual for a Paestan neck-amphora; as in Campanian, in 

contrast to Apulian where the panathenaic form is normally used, at Paestum the 

neck-amphora normally had a wide open mouth with grooved rim, a tall slender 

neck of cylindrical shape, flat handles springing out from the top of the neck and 

joining the shoulder on either side, and a body tapering downwards to a compara 

tively low foot (cf. nos. 87-91). Here the mouth is funnel-shaped, very solid, with no 

projecting rim, a low and very narrow neck, thick twisted handles (cf. the neck-

amphorae by Python and by the Aphrodite Painter, Paestum 21370 and 20303, nos. 

240 and 963 below), a very clearly defined shoulder, decorated on the obverse with a 

figured scene, a markedly ovoid body, curving downward to a profiled foot in several 

degrees. In fact it has something of the appearance of a mixture between a neck-

amphora and one of panathenaic shape; it might have been an experiment carried 

out under the Apulian influence brought about this time to Paestum by the 

Aphrodite Painter (see below, Chapter X), who clearly was a member of the 

workshop of Asteas and Python. This particular shape does not seem to have met 

with local approval, since it is not repeated in any extant vase. 

The obverse represents Orestes at Delphi, a subject very popular with South 

Italian vase-painters, perhaps distantly reflecting the Oresteia of Aeschylus. In the 

centre is the omphalos, in front of a single column on a low flat base, which is 

probably meant to stand for the stylobate of the temple; a long-haired Orestes, with 

petasos, chlamys and sandals clutches it, with a backward turn of his head, in terror 

at the Fury above him, as he brandishes his sword. Beside him a half-draped youth 

bends slightly forward over his raised left foot, his right arm raised in a gesture of 

horror. Like Orestes he is not identified by an inscription but he is presumably 

Pylades, who appears on other vases representing this scene, notably Python's krater 

in the B.M. (no. 239 below; cf. also Milan A 2162 = LCS, p. 251, no. 154, Kossatz-

Deissmann, p. 105, no. K37, pi. 23, 1). To right is the priestess (MANTIKAEIA), the 

temple-key in her left hand; her right is raised to indicate horror, like that of Pylades. 

She wears a chiton with a central stripe; across the lower part of her body is a short 

cloak with chequered border. The name is probably meant to indicate her oracular 

skill as priestess rather than to be a true name (cf. Manto on the lekythos no. 142 

below). 

Above, seen as a row of half-figures, we have on the left Apollo (AFIOAAQN), 

laurel-crowned with a sceptre, then two Furies, Megaira and Allecto (MEI~AIPA; 

AAAHK ..), one on each side of the column, wearing elaborate costumes and holding 

snakes in their hands. On the right is a bearded silen, a fawn-skin knotted round his 

throat, looking down on the scene below. 

The reverse follows the usual pattern�below, a nude youth between two 

standing draped women, the one to left wearing a peplos with a central dot-stripe, 

"Brommer, VD, pp. 455-6; see also Watzinger, FR iii, pp. 362 ff., with list on pp. 365-6, note 8;

the one to right enveloped in a himation with a dot-stripe border, both stock figures 

who reappear on many vases. Above are the busts of two women, both looking 

downwards. 

On the neck of the obverse is a siren, a bead necklace in one hand and a fillet in 

the other; on the reverse, a female head in profile to left, the hair done up in a black-

dotted sphendone. There is a black bead necklace, and the shoulders are just visible, 

showing the fold-lines of the upper part of the peplos, as on many of the heads 

beneath the handles of hydriai (e.g. nos. 73-4, 76, 78). Below the neck panels on 

both sides is a band of alternating black and reserved rectangles, as on no. 129, 

perhaps meant to represent dentils. 

The shoulder on the obverse is decorated with a figured scene between two 

standard framing palmettes. To left is a speckled bird which we shall see again on 

several of the minor vases, then a nude youth bending forward over his left foot, 

which rests upon a rock-pile, shown in added white relieved by diluted glaze; a 

woman seated on a similar rock-pile turns her head back in his direction. Towards 

her runs up a nude Eros, and behind him sits a woman enveloped in her himation, 

another figure we shall meet again on many of the smaller vases. The main pictures 

are framed between reserved bands; below the handles are superposed palmettes, 

with side-scrolls similar in form to framing palmettes, with palmette-fans also below 

the spirals at the base of the upper fan and at the bottom of the side-scrolls. The core 

of the lower fan is a series of triangles. 

The comparatively poor state of preservation of the obverse makes it difficult to 

pass judgment on the drawing of most of the figures, but from what does remain it 

would be difficult to regard this as one of the artist's more inspired works. 

The Stheneboia Hydria in Paestum (no. 134; Pis. 55-6) 

This vase was found in a painted chamber-tomb excavated in the spring of 1967 in 

the area known as 'Contrada Vecchia' some 3 km. south-east of Agropoli. The side-

walls of the tomb showed a scene of combat and a chariot race (of which very little 

survives), the end wall the return of a warrior. Two depositions had been made in 

the tomb, one slightly earlier than the other; the former included a bell-krater 

attributed to Asteas (20198; no. 173 below), two early r.f. fish-plates (20187-8, one 

by the Bastis Painter = GRFP, no. IB/13, the other early Paestan = GRFP, no. 

IIIA/5, no. 924 below), and some vases decorated in applied red; the second, in 

addition to the hydria, included a lebes gamikos (20201, no. 185 below), a lekanis 

(20161, no. 150 below) both attributed to Asteas, a neck-amphora by one of his close 

associates (20199, no. 380 below) and a number of smaller items. The hydria was 

badly broken and much of the detail of the figures depicted upon it is no longer 

visible; the figures were all inscribed and the vase was signed with incised letters 
 E!~[pcx(pE) in the area just above the spot where the sticks of Bellerophon 

and Proitos cross. 

The main scene represents the departure of Bellerophon 

([BEJAAEPOOONTHZ) from the palace of Proitos (nPOlTOZ) who is handing him 

the cxr)uon-a Auypd for transmission to Iobates. To right Stheneboia (C0ENEBOIA) is 

seated on a klismos, her handmaid (AZZTYANAZ[ZA]) beside her. Above in a loggia, 

 For a full account of the hydria and its discovery see Bottini and Greco, 'Tomba a camera dal 

territorio pestano', in Dial, di Arch. 8/2, 1974-5, pp. 231 ff. It is no. 13 on p. 230ff., figs. 16-17. The 

paintings are reproduced in Colour-plates A and B. 

similar to that on the Madness of Herakles krater (no. 127) may be seen the bust of 

Aphrodite (AOPOAITH) between those of two Furies, one inscribed AAAEKO 

(Allecto). The scene appears on many other South Italian vases, but this is the only 

one which seems to have a direct connection with a stage performance, since all the 

characters wear elaborately patterned costumes and the loggia in the background is 

almost certainly (as on no. 127) inspired by the theatre. Pegasus does not appear in 

this version, but Stheneboia's maid is named for the first time. Astyanassa was also 

the name of Helen's servant in Sparta and Asteas may have used it as a generally 

appropriate name for a maid rather than taking it from Euripides. We may note 

that, as in his spelling of his own name, he doubles the first sigma. 

On the shoulder is a three-figured scene set into a rectangular panel framed by 

reserved bands. In the centre is a seated woman, dressed in a black tunic with the 

usual piece of drapery over the lower part of her body; in her left hand, she holds a 

mirror, in her right a phiale and a red fillet, which she extends in the direction of an 

Eros who runs up from the left; on the other side of her a young nude satyr bends 

forward over his raised right foot. Beneath each of the side-handles is a predatory 

bird with open wings perched on a dotted rock; another bird appears above on the 

shoulder on each side of the figured panel. Below the back-handle are superposed 

palmettes, with side-scrolls, and 'Asteas flowers'. The rim of the mouth is decorated 

with reverse wave-pattern, the neck is tall and slender, with a reserved zone 

immediately below the mouth, a band of black and another decorated with laurel 

and a central flower. 

In style the vase stands close to the Cadmus krater (no. 132); Stheneboia may 

be compared with Thebe on that vase, and the bust of Aphrodite with the central 

one on its reverse. 

The Hesperides Lekythos in Naples (no. 135; PI. 57) 

The Hesperides lekythos was found in the excavations of 1805 in the vicinity of the 

Porta Aurea at Paestum under the direction of Felice Nicolas and published almost 

immediately afterward by Luigi Lanzi. The vase is intact and in excellent 

condition, the added white and the incised inscriptions almost perfectly preserved. 

Herakles was always a popular subject with the vase-painter, and not the least 

favoured of his labours is the quest for the golden apples of the Hesperides. The 

legend appears in two versions: the first, which is commoner on early vases, shows 

Herakles supporting the heavens while Atlas brings him the apples, the second shows 

him actually in the garden surrounded by the nymphs, and it is this version of the 

story which the later vase-painters prefer.

An as yet unpublished Apulian volute-krater by the Underworld Painter gives an unusual version 

of the legend; on the upper level are Peitho, Aphrodite, Selene, Pan and Athena, and below, a youthful 

Herakles, Atlas seated upon a throne with Ge standing beside him, a Hesperid and the apple-tree. The 

principal figures are all inscribed. 

In the centre of our vase is the apple-tree, laden with golden fruit. Round it is 

coiled a rather harmless-looking serpent, which has been drinking something from 

the phiale held out to it by one of the nymphs. It has a small crest and a beard in 

purple-red, and a yellow body, white on the underside, with the scales outlined in 

thinned glaze. On the ground level are grouped three figures each side of the tree; 

two more appear above as busts. On the left stand Aiopis (AlfiFTlZ), whose left hand 

rests on the shoulder of Antheia (AN0EIA); the latter holds one of the apples up to 

her mouth. Beside her sits Calypso (KAAYYQ) on an elaborate white tendril. On the 

other side another nymph plucks an apple from the tree to give to Herakles 

(hEPAKAHZ), who stands beside her, his right foot resting on a dotted mound, his 

lion-skin hanging down his back and his club and bow in his hand. He is here 

represented, as often in the quest for the golden apples, as a youth, and not as the 

bearded figure familiar from earlier vases. On the extreme right is another nymph, 

Nelisa (NHA1ZA), who, like Antheia, is holding an apple up to her mouth. Above to 

left are the busts of Pan (cf. no. 39) and a woman with a veil, inscribed TAPA; to 

right, those of Hermes and a nymph inscribed AONAKIZ. Immediately above the 

tree, just below the flower in the centre of the shoulder ornament, is the incised 

inscription ' AcrCTTeaS Iypa9�, while to the left of the tree at the top is the inscription 

hZZTTEPIAZ, standing no doubt for Hesperides and analogous to the TTEPZAI on the 

Darius krater.

Not all the names inscribed on this vase are easy of interpretation. Lanzi 

misread a number of them and took them to be Oscan, thereby obtaining rather 

peculiar interpretations for them. Herakles, Aiopis, Antheia or Calypso present no 

difficulties. Nelisa is not found elsewhere, and may be a corruption of Melissa; but 

what about Tdpoc, Mpixr)cra and Aovooas? The second appears just below the bust of 

Hermes, and one may reasonably conclude that the artist, intending to name the 

nymph who is gathering the apples, allowed his eye to wander to the bust above and 

confused the two names. The woman inscribed TAPA is wearing a veil, and this is an 

attribute more suited to a goddess than a nymph, or to a personification like Thebe 

on the Cadmus krater. Such an interpretation is in keeping also with the normal 

arrangement of the figures on an Asteas vase�the mortals on the lower register, and 

above them the gods or various personifications to localise the scene. The obvious 

explanation is to make the T into the aspirate sign h and the name into hAPA, a form 

of Hera in which an alpha has been substituted for the eta. Hera deserves a place in 

the story because the gardens of the Hesperides were given to her as a wedding 

present, and because it was she who caused the twelve labours to be imposed upon 

Herakles. Further, as the enemy of Herakles she makes a good counterpart to 

Hermes, the Helper, who balances her on the right side of the tree. The other figure 

is inscribed AONAKIZ, and balances Pan. Early authorities read the first two letters 

as A0 and tried to transform her into Athena, but the letters are AO, and she has 

none of the attributes of that goddess. Donakis is a name otherwise unknown; one 

naturally assumes, as Patroni did, some connection with 86vcc� � a reed. She is 

probably not a Hesperid, for they are confined to the lower register, and as the figure 

who balances Pan, she may well be taken as the personification of a stream or lake 

beside which would grow the reeds from which she derived her name, and he his 

syrinx. 

For such 'titles' on South Italian vases see RVAp I, p. liii and II, p. 484. 

The decorative pattern-work is essentially simple. A band of egg and dot, 

enlivened with a touch of white, runs round the neck immediately below the mouth, 

and beneath it a band of tongues spreads downwards on to the shoulder, which is 

decorated with berried laurel wreaths in added white meeting in a central flower. 

Beneath the handle are superposed palmette-fans with sprung central leaves and 

elaborate side-scrolls terminating in an 'Asteas flower'. On either side of the lower 

fan are leaves with serrated edges. 

The design is a splendid example of a balanced composition; in fact, one so 

symmetrical as to be almost monotonous. In the centre is the tree with the serpent; 

each side of it is a group of three full-length figures, with two busts above them. The 

only variation lies in the grouping of the threes, and even there Nelisa is posed very 

similarly to Aiopis, and holds up an apple to her mouth like Antheia. The symmetry 

is emphasised by an almost isokephalic arrangement, despite the fact that not all the 

figures are standing, by the virtual absence of any connecting links between them, 

and by the fact that they all face the tree with their heads seen in profile. 

The drapery is the heavy, elaborately-patterned kind that is particularly dear 

to Asteas and his followers, and on this vase almost the whole repertory of patterns 

appears�stars and circles on the body of the garment, wave-pattern, palmettes, 

chequers and engrailing for the borders. Stripes run down the middle of the front of 

the chiton�plain with yellow beads or else in a fish-bone pattern. The drapery itself 

is stiff and looks often as if it had been cut out from metal, for the folds tend to fall in a 

very mechanical way, with little regard for the actual position of the limbs. For 

instance, Aiopis, Nelisa and the apple-gatherer all have one leg drawn back, and yet 

the folds of their drapery fall in vertical lines to the ground as if both feet were placed 

flat together on it. The drapery of Calypso is very clumsy, especially about the waist 

and shoulder, and gives her the appearance of being wrapped up in it. 

Hermine Speier (RM 47, 1932, p. 57) points out changes that were taking place 

in sculptural poses and drapery in the second quarter of the fourth century B.C. and 

draws a good parallel between the figure of Athena on a documentary relief dating 

to the archonship of Molon in 362/1 and that of Aiopis on the Asteas lekythos (op. 

cit., pis. 21,1 and 2). We might, therefore, reasonably expect this vase to be dated 

late in that quarter of the century, contemporary with the bell-kraters and hydriai in 

the preceding chapter, which yield many parallels in both pose and drapery to the 

figures on the lekythos.

The hair is for the most part rendered en masse, and is often done up with an 

elaborate head-band; if long, it hangs down on to the shoulders, with individual 

curls appearing only at the ends, and without relief lines to emphasise them. The 

very straight line for the back of Herakles is characteristic of the work of Asteas, 

especially for figures in this pose. The fired clay of the vase is far darker than that 

generally used by Asteas, with the result that the adjuncts in white and yellow show 

up more clearly, and the white of the serpent in the middle and of the apples on the 

tree makes a good contrast with the otherwise rather sober colouring. 

From the extant vases it would appear that Asteas was prepared to put his 

signature only on his more monumental works, with mythological or theatrical 

subjects, or else on those phlyax vases which seem to draw their inspiration direct 

from a stage performance. He presumably though the signed works to be his 

 E.g. cf. the white dots down the sleeves on no. 35; the bent leg of the woman on no. 43; the female 

heads below the handles of nos. 74�5, or on the neck of no. 89. 

masterpieces and, while it is possible to find some merit in the phlyax scenes, the 

other compositions are over-pretentious and cannot really be regarded as successful. 

One feels he is much more at home with the simpler two- and three-figure 

compositions of the vases in Chapter IV or with some of those in Chapter VI. His 

earlier vases have a measure of vivacity (e.g. nos. 19, 24, 26, 35), a sense of 

movement and of humour that is hard to find in his later and more developed works. 

The Berlin and Villa Giulia phlyax vases have been shown to belong to the earlier 

phase of his career, which perhaps explains the greater liveliness of their treatment. 

Three of the vases with dramatic representations (nos. 127-8, 133) have about them 

something of the quality of a scene from an Italian grand opera�the hero in the 

centre in a highly theatrical pose, flanked by elaborately-costumed characters 

making conventional gestures (cf. with Python's Alkmene krater, no. 239). Even 

some of the other vases (the Cadmus krater, the Stheneboia hydria and the 

Hesperides lekythos) produce a not dissimilar effect, and the apparent difference in 

the scene on the Europa krater is probably due to the fact that it is taking place over 

the sea and that the busts and half-length figures are relegated to the two triangular 

spaces at the top. The reverses of his kraters tend to show an even more symmetrical, 

one might almost say monotonous, system of composition. On nos. 126-8 it follows 

the formula 

the central figure on the lower level being in each case Dionysos. A very similar 

formula is used not only for the reverses of no. 129, where the lower level follows it 

exactly, but the upper has five busts separated by a reserved stripe, and of nos. 

132-3, where the number of busts in the upper level is reduced, but also for the 

obverse designs of nos. 127, 128, 133 and for that on no. 135. In most cases the figures 

in the upper level are completely separate from those below; the Madrid krater and 

the Stheneboia hydria try to avoid the artificial appearance of the row of busts by 

placing them in a loggia above the scene of action and thus to some extent 

integrating them into the whole structural scheme. On the Cadmus krater (no. 132) 

Thebe appears as a full-scale figure and not a bust, thus linking the two registers, and 

the Europa krater (no. 129) uses a new and original method of accommodating the 

supporting figures, with a rather curious result. It must be admitted that compo 

sition on the larger scale was not the forte of Asteas, and we shall see precisely the 

same weakness in that of his colleague Python. His strong predilection for rigidly 

symmetrical compositions tends to give them a lifeless and artificial look; there are 

ready parallels to be found in the naiskos- and stele-scenes of later Apulian, which 

also make one wish for the freer disposition of the figures on the earlier kraters. 

If there is not much variety in the composition of his designs, there is, on the 

whole, even less in the figures which comprise them, since, in common with many 

other Italiote artists, Asteas has a habit of repeating his figures on different vases. He 

was quite capable of producing good, vigorous and original work, as the Cassandra 

fragment shows; but he is far too prone to allow his work to become mechanical, and 

the gestures of his figures often appear rather meaningless or purely conventional. 

At his best he can render drapery admirably with a few, telling strokes, but too 

often he neglects it and makes elementary mistakes in the treatment of folds, etc., 

with the result that it tends to look heavy and lifeless. The expressions on the faces of 

his characters show a similar lifelessness; often in scenes of some emotion they appear 

almost frozen, and that is why the Cassandra fragment stands out so much above the 

other vases, for there is real feeling expressed in the faces of the three figures on it. His 

happiest results in this direction seem to have been attained on vases with comic 

subjects. 

Attention has already been drawn to the number of stock figures which 

appeared on the earlier and usually less elaborate vases of Asteas; these we find 

repeated on the signed ones, especially on the reverses of the kraters, where the 

Dionysiac scenes are merely larger-scale versions of those on the vases in Chapter IV. 

These include the running figure, male or female, with arms spread out, the standing 

draped woman, the male figure bending forward over one raised foot, and the 

bearded silen. The following minor features of his drawing are worth noting: a 

tendency to arch the eyebrow well above the eye, instead of using three almost 

parallel strokes like Python; the highlighting of the eye with a touch of white; the 

straight forehead-nose line (very noticeable on the Hesperides lekythos) and the 

curving line to mark the nostril; the flat line of the back, when a figure is bending 

forward over a raised leg (as with Dionysos on the reverse of no. 128 or Herakles on 

no. 135�cf. also nos. 74�5, 93�4); the careful rendering of hands and figures, with a 

tendency to taper the latter off to rather sharp points. Asteas seldom draws heads in 

any but a profile view; his three-quarter faces (Helle, the mad Herakles, the silen on 

the reverse of no. 127) show that he can, in fact, render them with considerable skill 

and effect, and it is rather surprising that he makes so little use of them and never of a 

completely frontal face. Relief lines are generally used for the hair, but on the less 

important characters, it may simply be blocked in on the head, with a mass of curls 

falling down onto the shoulders. He continues his use of dot-striped drapery, so 

familiar to us from the earlier vases, but the characters in mythological scenes wear 

far more elaborate garments, with embroidered patterns, bordered with chequers or 

rays. There is a good deal of added colour�red, yellow, orange and white�and 

diluted glaze is used effectively on fawn-skins and on the bodies of birds or marine 

creatures. 

The earliest of his signed vases (the Berlin krater and the Hesperides lekythos) 

could hardly be dated much before the middle of the fourth century and the others 

seem best placed in the third quarter of that century. 

The two preceding chapters dealt with the earlier work of Asteas and the eleven 

vases with bear his signature, most of which came from the more mature phase of his 

activity; in the present chapter the unsigned vases from that period are listed, 

together with others closely related to them in style. In PP many of these vases were 

assigned to an 'Asteas Group'; the evidence provided by the material which has 

recently come to light suggests that most of them are probably by Asteas himself, 

especially in view of the rendering of the draped youths on their reverses. Others can 

now be attributed to new painters (see Chapter VIII), whose existence had not 

previously been established. Sometimes the vases fall into small sub-groups in which 

the individual items which compose them are linked together by some repeated 

feature, like the black and red drapery on nos. 152-64, and these may be the work of 

close imitators rather than of the painter himself. The work of Python, who is a very 

close collaborator of Asteas, is not always very easy to distinguish from that of the 

latter, although the new vases have made an important contribution to this end for 

those of larger dimensions. The smaller vases, however, decorated with single figures 

or female heads have been mostly grouped together in Chapter IX as minor 

products of the Asteas-Python workshop. 

The vases dealt with in this chapter fall into two main categories. In the first, 

the subjects, whether Dionysiac or mythological, are treated in a more elaborate 

manner, with multi-figured compositions in which the principal characters wear 

richly-patterned garments; in the second the compositions are simpler, usually with 

only two figures, and carry on the tradition of his earlier work, as exemplified by the 

vases discussed in Chapter IV. 
(i) Dionysiac 

The vases in this division all have Dionysiac subjects, comparable to those on 

reverses of the signed kraters nos. 125-6, 128-9, 132-3 in Chapter V.

The Sydney krater (no 136) is comparable in shape and size with the signed 

krater in Madrid (no. 127); the picture on the obverse is framed between reserved 

bands with a touch of white at the top, giving something of the effect of a capital (as 

on nos. 129 and 132), and on the reverse between two of the standard framing 

palmettes. The handle-zone on the obverse is decorated with a band of meanders 

and chequers (cf. the reverses of nos. 125-7), on the reverse a saltire square with 

triangles in the intersections replaces the chequer. The scene on the obverse 

represents maenads and silens disposed at different levels in the manner favoured by 

Asteas, though perhaps slightly less symmetrically than usual. The upper register 

shows the body of a bearded silen, his legs cut off behind a white ground line; he has 

a fawn-skin wrapped round his left arm, and holds a thyrsus and a wreath. Both he 

and his counterpart on the lower level are typical of the bearded silen as painted by 

Asteas (cf. no. 46 and the reverse of no. 129; also nos. 137-8), and the female bust 

finds good parallels on the reverses of nos. 128, 132 and 133. The three draped 

women all have dot-stripes down their drapery, or as borders to it, and the drawing 

of their faces should be compared with that of the Hesperides on no. 135. Both the 

youths on the reverse, rather exceptionally for Asteas, have dot-stripe borders to 

their himatia (cf. nos. 139 a, 164, 177, 181, 183 below); the stance of the youth to left 

is a variant of Al, in which the body is more or less frontal as in A3c, but with a 

'sling' rather than a 'V drape. Several of the figures on the obverse find prototypes 

on the vases by the Painter of Louvre K236 (see p. 34 above), as may be seen by 

comparing the female figure and the silens with those on nos. 1 /62-4 and 68, and this 

once again illustrates the relationship between the early work of Asteas and the 

Sicilian forerunners. 

The second calyx-krater (no. 137) is of particular interest for the subject of its 

obverse and for the close relationship between its reverse and that of the signed 

phlyax krater in Berlin (no. 125), which it also resembles in shape, size and pattern-

work. The obverse shows a very typical Dionysos, the lower part of his body covered 

with a piece of dot-stripe bordered drapery, seated on an enclosed fan-palmette in 

added white (cf. nos. 37, 50, 55, 62 above); to left is a bearded silen, as on the 

preceding vase (cf. also nos. 175 and 184 below), to right a maenad wearing a peplos 

with a dot-stripe running vertically down it, but, as frequently, shifting slightly to 

the right on the lower portion; over it is a dappled fawn-skin. She finds counterparts 

on nos. 70-73 and 78, and indeed is another very characteristic stock figure in the 

Asteas repertory. Above is suspended a white-fleshed comic female mask (Type SS), 

very similar to those on no. 125. The reverse shows a nude Dionysos facing a young 

satyr, who holds out a phiale of eggs towards him; between the two is a plant with an 

'Asteas flower', and to right a simple palmette-scroll exactly as on no. 125 and on 

earlier vases like nos. 20 and 22. 

Both these kraters must therefore be comparatively early and would seem to be 

about contemporary with the Berlin phlyax krater and the Hesperides lekythos. 

The skyphos in Kassel (no. 138) is decorated on both sides with scenes in two 

registers; both contain the usual stock figures and the scenes are framed between 

reserved bands, with superposed palmette-fans below the handles, flanked below by 

framing palmettes of standard design, except for the one to right of the reverse, 

which is of the simpler form without the fans. The busts are close to those on the 

reverses of the two vases in San Antonio (nos. 128 and 133) and, indeed, the skyphos 

is reported to have come from the same tomb. The papposilen with his shaggy body, 

across which a fawn-skin is draped, appears on other vases by Asteas�e.g. no. 50 

and the reverse of no. 129, also on no. 171, together with a suspended female mask. 

Of the last vase in this sub-division (no. 139) only some joining fragments of the 

reverse remain; they depict a scene very similar to that on the reverse of the 

skyphos�a nude youth stands, here facing left instead of right, between two draped 

women; above are two female busts, of which the fingers of the one to right rest on 

the ground line behind which the lower part of her body is concealed, exactly as on 

the reverse of the Orestes amphora in San Antonio (no. 133). In view of the more 

elaborate composition on its reverse, the missing obverse may well have depicted a 

mythological scene, but of it no trace has yet been found. 

(*) 

Perhaps this is the best place to consider a calyx-krater, now in the Art Museum of 

San Antonio, which came to my notice only after this chapter had been written and 

which is known to me only from colour-photographs kindly sent to me by Dr. Carlos 

Picon. 

Calyx-krater 

*139a San Antonio SAMA 86-32 P(2) (ex Denman coll. 346). Ht. 33-5, diam. 32. PLATE 241 a, b 
[a) Papposilen bending slightly forward, holding out a white fillet to seated half-draped 
Dionysos, who holds a phiale and a wreath in his 1. hand; above, top left, bust of woman, 
[b) two draped youths. 

In shape this vase is close to nos. 136-7, with only a single black relief band 

round the stem above the foot, and without reserved stripes on either side of it (as on 

no. 137); the decoration on the obverse handle-zone consists of a saltire square (cf. 

the reverse of Geneva HR 29, no. 1 above) between two stopt meanders and, on the 

other side, of reverse wave (cf. no 181, where the foot is more elaborate and body 

shorter). There is nothing by way of a frame to the pictures on either side (in contrast 

to no. 136), nor any palmette scrolls, as on no. 137. 

On the obverse, a papposilen, whose body is covered with small tufts of white 

hair, and who has a piece of drapery with a chequer and ray-pattern border (cf. 

Paestum 26631, no. 151) across the upper part of his legs and over his left arm, which 

rests upon a stick, leans forward to offer a white fillet to Dionysos, who is seated upon 

an eminence decorated with white dot-clusters (cf. nos. 25, 28, 178), beside which is 

a small table on which are three eggs (cf. nos. 8, 61, 137, 175). The lower part of his 

body is covered by a cloak with a dot-stripe border; the fold-lines on it, especially in 

the area over his extended left leg, are drawn with unusual clarity, in bunches of two 

and three, in the same way as on the bell-krater in Tampa (no. 63). The composit

is of a type popular on vases from the Asteas-Python workshop and many parallels to 

it can easily be found (e.g. on nos. 8 and 50 or 65, 175, 179). For the papposilen we 

may compare Salerno 1813 (no. 50), the Kassel skyphos (no. 138), the bell-krater 

from Montesarchio (no. 171), and the lekanis lid Paestum 26633 (no. 152), though 

on all those he wears a skin across his body. On no. 152 the rendering of the body, 

with its tufts of white hair, the drawing of the face, with a touch of white in the eye 

and the snub nose, as well as the red-brown slippers with a band of white at the top, 

provide a very good parallel to the papposilen on the San Antonio krater. The seated 

Dionysos is comparable to those on nos. 8 (a somewhat earlier version of the same 

subject), 23, 50 and 55, with nos. 175 and 179 providing slightly later examples. The 

female bust, which appears in the top left corner, is near, as regards the drapery, 

head-dress and facial features, to the women on the hydria no. 29, the pelike 

Karlsruhe B 91 (no. 14), or the bell-krater Paestum 21206 (no. 35); even closer is the 

bust on the Geneva amphora (no. 183), where it is set in a similar surround of white 

dots. 

The obverse, therefore, supports an attribution of the vase to Asteas, probably 

at a fairly early stage in his career, not far away from nos. 136-7, or from his earlier 

signed vases. 

The reverse raises several problems, in regard both to the poses and the drapery 

of the two youths. The youth to left stands in an unusual pose for Paestan; his head is 

in profile to right, his body is almost fully frontal, with the himation so draped across 

it as to expose the right arm and shoulder, but to cover the left. The left arm is bent 

to produce a sort of 'sleeve' drape, and the hand beneath holds a white stick, which 

emerges from the 'sleeve'. The border of the himation is decorated with a dot-stripe; 

where the two edges meet below the left arm, the dot-stripes run down in parallel 

lines. The other youth is of Type A2r; he holds a white fillet in his exposed right 

hand; the left, concealed beneath the 'sleeve' over the arm, held a stick like his 

companion's. The edge of his 'sleeve' has no defined border, but below it two dot-

stripes run down as on the cloak of the other youth, though here the border at the 

bottom ends in a wavy line with a swirling double curve. No extant vase provides an 

exact parallel for these two, though they should be compared in general terms with 

those on Sydney 49-01 (no. 136) and on nos. 171, 176-7, 181 and 183. For the 

rendering of their heads nos. 60, 63 and 64 provide good parallels. The use of dot-

stripe borders on the cloaks of both youths is less common with Asteas than with 

Python, and comparable drapery to that on the reverse of the San Antonio krater 

can be found on some of the kraters assigned to the 'Altavilla Group', especially nos. 

230 and 234. The reverse, however, looks to me more in the style of Asteas than 

Python; this is certainly true, as we have already seen, of the obverse, and it therefore 

seems reasonable to place this vase, along with those which it most closely resembles, 

into the second phase of that painter's career, when some of his earlier mannerisms 

still linger, and when Python's work is still extremely close to his. It is perhaps not 

without significance that nos. 177 and 181 were originally assigned to the latter artist 

but have now, in the light of new evidence, been transferred to Asteas. 

(ii) Mythological 

The vases in this division all depict mythological scenes, comparable to those on nos. 

126, 129, 132-3 and 135 above, and characterised by the same use of elaborate and 

richly-patterned drapery for the principal characters. The range of subjects is 

limited, since mythology plays a far less dominant role on Paestan vases than on 

Apulian, but the treatment of the story of Apollo and Marsyas on no. 140 and of 

Cadmus on no. 141 is of particular interest for the unusual wealth of detail provided. 

The most popular theme is the Judgment of Paris which appears on now fewer than 

five vases (nos. 147-151); since the worship of Hera clearly played a very important 

role at Paestum, it is not surprising that Hera, despite her failure to win the beauty 

contest, is given a measure of preferential treatment on two of these vases (Brussels A 

813 and Paestum 4831 = nos. 147-8), where the two other goddesses are not shown 

at all. It reminds us of the amusing squat lekythos by the Sydney Painter, also found 

at Paestum, in which it is Hera who leads the procession of goddesses, whom Hermes 

is conducting to Paris {LCS, p. 129, no. 665; AntK 21, 1978, pi. 22, 1-3).

The Louvre lekanis (no. 140) was recognised as Paestan by Winnefeld (Bonner 

Studien, 1890, p. 167) and, to judge from the drawing of the faces, the rendering of the 

woman's drapery, and the appearance of berried laurel-branches, is one of Asteas's 

earlier major works. The scene depicts the contest between Apollo and Marsyas in 

the presence of three Muses, who acted as judges. Marsyas appears as a bearded 

silen, with a slightly downcast look, playing the flute; beside him sits Apollo, playing 

the cithara, round one arm of which is tied a red fillet. He wears a long-sleeved and 

richly-patterned robe, as befits a musician, with a cloak down his back. Beside him is 

a Muse, also with a cithara, who turns her head towards him, then comes another 

Muse with an open box and a white wreath, and a third who sits facing her, a 

tortoise-shell lyre held in her left hand and resting on the ground, again bedecked 

with a red fillet. Between her and Marsyas is a small shrine or temple, painted in 

'An exhaustive study of this subject will be found in J-M. Moret's article 'Le jugement de Paris en 

Grande-Grece' in AntK 21, 1978, pp. 76-98, pis. 21-8, where the relevant Paestan vases are numbered 

5-12, of which the first five (5-9) are those discussed in this chapter. Three are illustrated on pis. 22, 4; 

23, 1-3; and 24, 1-2. The Lucanian squat lekythos by the Sydney Painter is reproduced on 

pi. 22, 1-3. Earlier studies on the subject will be found in: C. Clairmont, Das Parisurteil in der antiken 

Kunst (Zurich, 1951) and I. Raab, %u den Darstellungen des Parisurteils in der gr. Kunst (Bern, 1972). 

On the contest between Apollo and Marsyas see, in particular, C. Clairmont in Yale Classical 

Studies 15, 1957, pp. 161-178 (where Louvre K 570 is not listed) and K. Schauenburg, 'Marsyas' in RM 

65, 1958, pp. 42-66 (with extensive earlier bibliography on p. 42), where the lekanis is no. 3 in the 

addenda to Clairmont's list on p. 50. It is not listed by Brommer in Gottersagen in Vasenlisten, p. 6. See also

Beazley, VPol, p. 76, where the popularity of this theme on Attic vases from c. 420 onwards is noted, and 

Metzger, Representations, pp. 158 ff. for a list of such vases. 

white and orange; it has engaged Ionic columns along the visible side, a fan-palmette 

in the pediment, and one free-standing column, but the problem of showing it in true 

perspective has proved beyond the capacity of the painter. Its presence, together 

with the berried laurel-branches which break up the scene, suggest that it might be 

located at Delphi. 

The Cadmus lekanis (no. 141) gives us a slightly fuller version of the story than 

that on the Naples krater (no. 132 above), with most of the principal figures 

identified by inscriptions. The lid has been recomposed from fragments and small 

portions of it are missing, as are certain letters of the names, which were originally in 

added white. In the centre is Cadmus (KAAMOZ), wearing a pilos and a chlamys, 

attacking the serpent with a stone, which he is about to throw with his right hand. 

Beside him on the ground is the amphora, shown in white and brown to simulate 

metal, with which he had gone to collect water from the spring, located in a rocky 

setting surrounded by trees and shrubs and guarded by the serpent. To the left are 

three female figures, all wearing patterned drapery; the first is seated and turns her 

head to left to look at the events taking place by the spring, the second is standing 

and rests her left hand on the shoulder of the third (cf. no. 135), who is seated beside 

a tall, leafy tree with white berries; most of her face is missing. They are inscribed 

0EBH, IZMHN., and AIPKH respectively, and personify the site and the two river-

gullies which flanked it on the east and west sides. To the right of the tree is Athena, 

wearing a helmet, with the aegis over her chiton, bending forward over her raised 

left foot and gesturing with her right hand to Cadmus. She bears no inscription, the 

painter presumably deeming it unnecessary in her case. Beside her, rising out of the 

ground, is a figure inscribed ANAK ... who, in LIMC 1, p. 757, is identified as 

Ananke by Erika Simon. 

In style, especially in the rendering of the drapery, this vase is perhaps closest to 

the Telephos krater in San Antonio (no. 128). The similarity in the treatment of the 

Cadmus scene here with that on the Naples krater and on the Louvre calyx-krater 

by Python (no. 241) suggests that all three may look back to some common original.

sheath, Medea (MHAEIA) bending forward to feed the serpent coiled around the tree to 
which the golden fleece is attached, Jason (IAZQN) holding spear, Peleus (rTEA..Z) seated 
beside him, Eros holding red fillet in both hands. 

The Orestes lekythos was found in May 1957 in a chamber tomb in the 

Contrada Gaudo, about a kilometre north of Paestum, together with a fish-plate 

(no. 922), a stemless cup (no. 158), some plain ware and numerous metal objects, 

including several pieces of bronze armour which are discussed and illustrated by 

Sestieri in his article in the Bollettino d'Arte for 1958. The inside walls of the tomb were 

painted; on the north side was a duel, with two other figures, which have largely 

disappeared, on the south, also badly damaged, a warrior, with spears in both 

hands, moves to left, in front of a chariot drawn by two horses. In shape, size, style 

and decoration the lekythos stands very close to no. 135 and the two are clearly 

products of the same potter and painter. The scene is presented in considerable 

detail, with an extensive use of added colours, white, yellow and red. In the centre, 

seated with drawn sword on an altar, in front of an Ionic column representing the 

temple of Apollo, is Orestes (OPE2THI); to his left is Apollo (AfTOAAQN), with a 

laurel-branch over his left shoulder and, in his right hand, a white piglet, which he 

holds over Orestes for the act of purification. On either side at the top of the column 

is the serpent-entwined bust of a Fury, TEIIIOONH to left and MEF"AIPA to right, 

both of whom wear deep red tunics, patterned with white dots. To left of the central 

scene below stands a goddess, wearing a crown with a veil and carrying a sceptre� 

she is Leto (AHTQ), mother of Apollo; to right is Artemis (APTEMI2), wearing an 

elaborately-patterned huntress costume and holding a spear in one hand and a bow 

in the other; at her feet is a white hound and behind her a white-haired priestess 

(MANTQ), with a wreath in one hand and an infula and a phiale in the other, stands 

beside an altar of which only part is visible. The purification of Orestes with the 

blood of a piglet is a comparatively rare subject in South Italian vase-painting; the 

other two best examples are both Apulian and are slightly earlier in date. 

The squat lekythos in Bochum (no. 143), which comes from the same tomb-

group as the two signed vases in San Antonio (see Chapter V, note 17), has been 

recomposed from fragments. Part of the figure of Jason is missing and there are a few 

minor restorations; much of the added colour, especially the white for the wreath on 

the shoulder and the red of the inscriptions, has worn off, but otherwise the vase is in 

a reasonably good condition. In shape, size and pattern-work, it corresponds closely 

with the preceding vase and with the signed Hesperides lekythos (no. 135), although 

the body is slightly more squat. The palmette decoration at the back below the 

handle combines elements from that on each of the other two lekythoi; the 

superposed palmette-fans are like those on no. 141, the side tendrils, terminating in 

'Asteas flowers', are as on no. 135. All three have the same berried laurel-wreath in 

added white on the shoulder with a campanula flower in the centre; each, however, 

has a handle of different type: on no. 135 it is flanged, on no. 141 it is horizontally 

ribbed and here ridged, with a deep central groove. 

In the centre of the picture, framed as usual between reserved bands, is a tree 

with leafy boughs, on the top branches of which rests the golden fleece (now worn 

away in part). Round the trunk of the tree is coiled a crested snake, the body of 

which was originally painted white with scales in dilute glaze. Beside the tree to left is 

Medea (MHAEIA), elaborately dressed and wearing a red Phrygian cap; she bends 

Bell-kraters, Louvre K710 [RVAp I, p. 97, no. 4/229; Kossatz-Deissmann, p. 105, no. K41, 

pi. 20,2, with bibliography) and once Milan market, Finarte, Cat. 5, no. 85 [RVAp, loc. cit., no. 230), 

both by the Eumenides Painter, c. 360 B.C. The bell-krater B.M. F 166 [RVAp I, loc. cit., no. 282) shows 

Apollo purifying Orestes with drops from two leaves, which he has presumably dipped into the phiale 

he holds in his left hand. The whole subject is discussed in detail by R. R. Dyer in his article "The 

evidence for Apolline purification rituals at Delphi and Athens' in JHS 89, 1969, pp. 39-56, where the 

three vases referred to above are illustrated on pis. 2, 1-2 and 3, 3; cf. also Leningrad 298, pi. 4, 5. 

slightly forward over her left foot, which rests upon a rockpile; in her left ha

holds an oenochoe and with her right she offers a phiale (now almost entirely 

missing), to the serpent, from which it will presumably drink some sort of soporific 

potion. On the other side of the tree stands Jason (IAZQN); he has a pilos on his head 

and wears a short chiton, with embroidered decoration and a wave-pattern border, 

and grasps a spear in his right hand. Behind him is a youthful warrior inscribed 

FTEA-.Z (Peleus), seated on a large rock-pile, wearing a pilos and a chlamys, and 

turning his head to left in the direction of Jason. Beside him stands a small figure of 

Eros holding a red fillet with both hands. On the other side there is only a single 

figure behind Medea, a youth, inscribed KAAAI2, accoutred in similar fashion to 

Peleus, but standing, with a spear in one hand and a sword in the other. Both Peleus, 

son of Aiakos, and Kalais, son of Boreas, took part in the expedition according to the 

lists given by Apollonius Rhodius (i, 94 and 211) and Hyginus (Fab. 14), but it is 

surprising to see Kalais here without the wings with which he is usually shown. The 

presence of Eros is readily explained by the fact that he was ordered by Aphrodite to 

pierce the heart of Medea with his arrow so that she would be inflamed with love for 

Jason and thus assist him in the tasks he was required to fulfil. 

The story of the Golden Fleece appears comparatively rarely on South Italian 

vases; another Paestan version, with a somewhat similar treatment of Medea and the 

serpent-guarded tree, but with a completely different Jason, will be found on the 

Apulianising volute-krater Naples 3248 (no. 3/630 below), otherwise we must turn 

to Lucanian and Apulian.

Fragments (from large vases) 

144 Paestum 3781-3, 3789, 3793, from Temple B in the Temenos. 
PAdd, no. A 18 (NF 3). 

There are several figured fragments, many of which do not join; at first, when 

only a few of them were available, I thought the vase might have been a neck-

amphora and interpreted one of the Furies as a possible Eros; later, when more 

fragments had come to light, it was clear that the vase must have been a large squat 

lekythos similar to 4794 (no. 142). One fragment shows a woman, wearing a black 

chitoniskos over a long embroidered garment with a black border, kneeling on the 

base of a column, which she appears to be clutching; behind her is the hand and part 

of the leg of a youth, in front of her the hand of a figure leaning on a stick. Another 

two fragments show the Ionic capital of the column, which is flanked on each side by 

the bust of a Fury, .... I PA � Megaira to left and TE = Teisiphone to right, as

shoulder of the kneeling woman and of the head and torso of the youth behind her,

other Argonauts; bell-krater, Turin, priv. coll. by the Jason Painter, an associate of the Lecce Painter 

[RVAp I, p. 133, no. 5/294, pi. 43,3), showing Jason, with drawn sword, to left of the tree and Medea, 

with a small box, to right; volute-krater, Leningrad 1718 = St. 422 [RVAp I, 424, no. 16/55), by a 

follower of the Lycurgus Painter. This gives the fullest version of the scene with Jason, assisted by 

various Argonauts, including the winged Kalais, attacking the serpent, and Medea, holding a box, 

above to right, accompanied by Eros. 

who was wearing a chlamys and held a spear (or stick). Two small fragments give a 

little more of the youth's body, with part of the frame, and a small portion of the 

frame where it meets the frieze of egg-pattern above the picture. The remaining 

fragment shows the head of a woman. 

The scene was originally thought to represent the meeting of Orestes and 

Electra at the tomb of Agamemnon, and this may be the correct interpretation, since 

two Furies appear in this context on Geneva HR 29 (no. 1 above), although the pose 

of Electra would be unusual. It does not seem to represent Orestes and Cly-

temnestra, as on Malibu 80 AE 155, 1 (no. 418 below), since the attitude of the 

youth to right does not appear to be hostile. That the fragments come from a vase by 

Asteas is clear from the treatment of the drapery, the drawing of the faces and the 

rendering of the busts of the two Furies. 

145 Paestum, from C. Licinella (1968)�sporadic, environs of T. 6-8. From a large hydria. 
Dionysiac scene�the upper level seems to have been divided up as on the "loggia" 
scenes on Madrid 11094 and Paestum 20202 (nos. 127 and 134); in the first compartment is 
the bust of a woman, who held a thyrsus with a red fillet; below is part of a satyr with a thyrsus 
and a small part of another figure, who held a thyrsus with a fillet tied round it. 

The two following are small fragments: 

146A Paestum 28872, from C. Andriuolo (1969)�sporadic. 12x11 cm. 
Part of a bearded silen (Marsyas ?) and Apollo, holding a cithara in his 1. hand. 
The inner side of the fragment is not glazed, so it must come from a closed vessel. 

Apollo, whose head is mostly missing, has long hair in the typical Asteas 

manner, wears an embroidered cloak with an embroidered star-pattern over his 

long-sleeved chiton; he turns his head in the direction of the silen, of whom only the 

mouth, beard and a portion of the torso remain, and makes an admonitory gesture 

with his hand. The fragment probably formed part of a picture showing the contest 

between Apollo and Marsyas, as on Louvre K570 (no. 140). 

146B Paestum 28847, from C. Andriuolo (1969)�sporadic. 11 x 9 cm. 
Part of a warrior, with a shield over his 1. arm. The scene was framed between reserved 
bands, with the standard 'framing' palmette. From a large open vase, probably a krater. 

The shield is seen from the inside and is painted in black, red and black, with a 

white border; the warrior's forearm passes through the arm-band and the fingers of 

his hand firmly grasp the hand-grip. He wears a short, sleeved tunic; it has a 

chequered border, with fringe, visible on his thigh (cf. Hera on no. 147), which is all 

that remains of his body. 
(b) The Judgment of Paris 

Of the five vases representing the Judgment of Paris, the first two give us the 

truncated version in which only the goddess Hera appears, the others show all three.

[a) Judgment of Paris�Paris seated in the centre on an Ionic capital, with his dog beside 
him; to 1., Hera wearing crown and holding 'skewer of fruit', and r., Hermes, [b) seated 
draped woman in front of whom stands Eros, resting his 1. hand on her knee. 
The lid has been largely recomposed; on the bowl of the lebes was [a) seated woman; 
(b) is missing. 
The plastic decoration on the shoulder of the obverse has been lost; on the reverse it 
consisted of two small lebetes gamikoi, decorated with heads in added white, which has now 
largely worn off. 

The Brussels hydria, from which old repainting has long since been removed, 

shows Paris seated upon a rock, between Hermes and Hera. Paris wears an 

unusually elaborate Phrygian costume, with mitra, long-sleeved tunic with bands of 

ray and wave pattern on it (cf. Apollo on Louvre K570), as well as on the trousers 

beneath it, and high laced boots; he holds a sword in his right hand and a staff in his 

left. He looks towards Hermes, who bends forward over his raised left foot, a 

caduceus in his right hand, his petasos behind his head. Excellent parallels to his 

pose will be found on such hydriai as nos. 74�6 above, though here there is a chlamys 

over his left shoulder and arm, and he is wearing high laced boots. On the other side 

of Paris in Hera, wearing a crown with a veil beneath it (cf. Thebe on no. 132 and 

Leto on no. 142) and a long peplos embroidered with stars, and with ray and 

chequer border-patterns. 

Below the side-handles are female heads comparable to those on nos. 70-1, 74�5 

and 77; and below the back-handle are superposed palmettes with side tendrils 

terminating in 'Asteas flowers', one of which also appears on a framing palmette 

beside Hera. The decoration corresponds very closely with that below the handle of 

the Bochum lekythos (no. 143). 

The lebes from the Heraion at Paestum (no. 148) is not well preserved; the 

upper part of Paris is missing and much of the lid is a restoration, but otherwise the 

scene closely resembles that on the Brussels hydria with the direction reversed, since 

Paris here faces to right. Hermes stands in front of him and is now equipped with 

winged boots; Hera has hardly changed, either in pose or costume. The reverse 

depicts a seated woman, in front of whom an Eros bends slightly forward, to rest one 

hand upon her knee. We have already seen a somewhat similar theme on the earlier 

hydriai like nos. 74 and 75; as we shall see, it becomes a very popular subject for 

lebetes gamikoi in this workshop. The pictures are again framed between reserved 

bands and the superposed palmette-fans below the handles follow the standard 

pattern. 

The three remaining vases give the full version of the story.

The volute-krater is a most unusual shape to find at Paestum, since its use is 

otherwise virtually confined to Lucanian and Apulian, and the only three other 

examples from Paestum all come from the Apulianising phase (nos. 3/629-30 a 

below). Paestum 32128 (no. 149) comes from Tomb 3 at Tempa Rossa di Fonte, 

where in 1964 a small group of tombs was excavated, the contents of which were all 

in an extremely damaged state. The vases have now been put together, as far as 

possible, but several of them (e.g. 32115 from T. 2 and 32142 from T. 3) are in such a 

poor state that a definite attribution is hardly possible. Apart from the volute-krater 

Tomb 3 contained a squat lekythos (32129, no. 209 below) and two fish-plates 

(32130 and 32142; see under no. 962 below), and these look to be by Asteas or closely 

associated with him. In its present state it is difficult to make a positive attribution of 

the volute-krater, but from a careful examination of what remains I should incline to 

think it to be by the painter himself. The busts in the upper register, the treatment of 

the drapery, especially that of Paris, the pose of Hermes and of Hera all support a 

close connection with that artist, and the decorated base upon which it stands should 

be compared with the foot of the Europa krater in Malibu (no. 129) and its 

counterpart (no. 129A). It is possible that Asteas experimented with this particular 

shape on this vase, but regarded it as unsuccessful and painted no others. We should 

not overlook the fact that about this time the Aphrodite Painter, who must have had 

an Apulian background (see below p. 237), came to Paestum and seems to have 

worked alongside Asteas and Python. His extant vases illustrate the Paestanising of 

an essentially Apulian painter and it may have been under his influence that Asteas 

came to paint a volute-krater, since it is a most popular shape in Apulian and would 

undoubtedly have been very familiar to the Aphrodite Painter. The handles are not 

decorated with the characteristic later Apulian mascaroons, but are done in 

openwork and painted black, as on some of the volute-kraters by the Lycurgus 

Painter and his followers, which are almost the last of this type in Apulia and must 

be dated to the third quarter of the fourth century, or not long before the Aphrodite 

Painter migrated to Paestum. Another link with that painter may be seen in the 

profile female heads in the palmettes below the handles, which are comparable to 

those on his lekythoi (nos. 972 and 973 below), and which also appear on a lebes 

E.g. Bonn 100, by the Lycurgus Painter [RVAp, I, p. 417, no. 16/14, pi. 150, 1-2) and, still nearer,

Karlsruhe B4 and Naples 3222 [RVAp I, P- 431, nos. 16/81-2). For a brief discussion of the 

development of the volute-krater in Apulian see my article on divergences in 'Proceedings of the first 

Congress of Classical Archaeology', Sydney 1985', (forthcoming) 

gamikos from Agropoli (Paestum 20201), attributed below (no. 185) to Asteas 

himself. 

The main scene on the obverse is, as usual with the larger compositions by 

Asteas, divided into two registers. Below, Hermes bends forward in front of Paris, as 

on no. 147; Hera, with crown and sceptre, as on the two preceding vases stands 

behind him, and to right is Athena, whose helmet has now completely vanished. 

Above is an unidentifiable figure, then Eros, in added white now largely disap 

peared, the busts of Aphrodite, another woman and a bearded man. The reverse 

design is also on two levels, a seated woman by a laver, below, with Eros and, above, 

a seated woman, female bust, and another seated woman, with upraised hand. The 

neck is also decorated with a three-figure composition on either side�on the 

obverse, a figure seated on an altar between two standing figures, and on the reverse 

Eros between two women, but both are in a very bad state, as are the figures on the 

shoulder, which are unusual for a vase of this shape, and this again suggests an 

unfamiliarity with the normal decorative system. Noteworthy are the small cones 

which project outward from the base of the openwork section of the handles; these 

are typically found on the shoulders of Paestan lebetes gamikoi and must be a local 

'improvement' to the normal handles. 

The lekanis (no. 150) comes from the same tomb as the signed Stheneboia 

hydria (no. 134) and was found with a number of other vases, mostly in bad 

condition, from the workshop of Asteas. The scene has been discussed in some detail 

by both Greco and Moret; it gives the standard version of the story, with Hermes 

bending forward in front of Paris, dressed as usual in oriental costume with his dog 

beside him, and then Hera, Athena and Aphrodite, all wearing elaborately 

patterned drapery. The surface has been badly worn and much of the detail is now 

no longer visible, but the rendering of the drapery and the drawing of the faces of 

Hermes and Hera suggest that the vase is probably by Asteas himself. 

Of the vases depicting the Judgment of Paris much the most interesting and 

significant is the tall beaked oenochoe (shape 10) from Tomb 2 in the excavations at 

Contrada Gaudo in 1972, which was found together with a number of other 

elaborately painted vases by Asteas, which are discussed in division (iii) below. The 

shape is not a common one in Paestan, and it is interesting to note that the Aphrodite 

Painter also decorated a vase of this shape with the same subject (see below, p. 239); 

that the two painters are contemporary is clear from the fact that Tomb 2 contained 

a hydria by him as well as the vases attributed to Asteas. We may perhaps see in the 

two oenochoai with the Judgment of Paris a certain measure of rivalry between the 

two painters, but, as will become clear when we come to study the Aphrodite Painter 

in greater detail in Chapter X, the influence of Asteas upon him was far greater than 

any he himself exerted on his Paestan colleagues. 

The oenochoe gives us a standard version of the Judgment, except that Paris's 

dog does not appear. In the centre is Paris seated, wearing the elaborate Oriental 

costume with which we are now quite familiar; his left hand grasps a stick, his right is 

held out towards Hermes, who stands in front of him, bending slightly forward over 

his raised left foot. He has a chlamys over his shoulder and down his back, a petasos 

behind his head, and the caduceus in his left hand; between him and Paris is a tree. 

To left stands Aphrodite, richly draped with a red bandeau round her head, looking 

Greco in Dial, di Arch. 8/2, 1974-5, pp. 260-1, no. 17; Moret in AntK 21, 1978, pp. 76 ff. 

slightly up at a small figure of Eros, originally in added white but now almost 

completely lost, except for part of his wings. Behind Paris stands Hera, almost a 

replica of the one on the Brussels hydria (no. 147) and then Athena, seated, in full 

panoply, with helmet, aegis, spear and shield and a somewhat anxious look on her 

face. The picture is framed between reserved bands; at the back are superposed 

palmettes with side tendrils terminating in 'Asteas flowers', as on nos. 135 and 147. 

On the shoulder was a grape-vine in added white (cf. the stand of no. 149), and at 

the handle-joins on the shoulder two plastic female heads, with white faces, wearing 

Phrygian caps. It is one of the best of the unsigned vases by Asteas, closest in style 

perhaps to his three squat lekythoi (nos. 135, 142-3) and to the Europa krater (no. 

129), on the reverse of which we see the same use of white beads on the short sleeves 

as with Athena here. We may also note the fringe to Hera's drapery, as on the 

fragment (no. 146B) and the Brussels hydria (no. 147). 

(iii) The Black and Red Group�Vases from C. Gaudo (1972), Tomb 2, and others clo

related to them 
(a) Vases from C. Gaudo (1972), Tomb 2 

See Atti XIIF CStMG 1973, p. 365 and pi. 61. 

The excavations of 1972 in the Contrada Gaudo brought to light several 

painted tombs, of which no. 2 is the most interesting, both for its paintings and the 

vases which accompanied the burial. The paintings, which are of very high quality, 

represented on the two long sides�N. a quadriga, with a cock on a column (26629); 

S. prothesis, with two women on either side (26627), and on the two short ones�E. a 

duel (26628); W. a flying demon (26626). The contents included several red-figured 

vases (26630-8 and 26605), of which the Judgment of Paris oenochoe (26631) has 

just been discussed; of the remainder the hydria 26605 is by the Aphrodite Painter 

(no. 975 below); the large lebes gamikos (26630) is attributed to the Painter of 

Wurzburg H5739 (no. 382 below); inv. 26634 a lekythos, the body of which is 

shaped more or less like an alabastron, and is decorated with a woman and Eros 

beside a laver, but was not visible in 1985; the others, which look to be the work of 

one hand, are as follows:

The painted tombs are listed by Eileen Corrigan in Lucanian Tomb-Paintings, pp. 665-675, though 

T. 4, which is very badly preserved, is not included. T. 2 is briefly discussed in Atti XIII CStMG 1973, p. 

365, and illustrated on pi. 61. 

"From the inventory number one would suspect that the hydria 26605, by the Aphrodite Painter, 

should have come from Tomb 1, where the paintings bear the numbers 26601-4 and the vases, which 

are decorated in applied red and listed in Appendix 1, nos. 26608-15, but all the museum records put 

the hydria with the other vases from T. 2, and it is included in the tomb-group reproduced on pi. 61, 2, 

of the Atti.

[a) Draped woman to 1. with 'skewer of fruit' and wreath, [b) nude youth with white fillet 
and thyrsus. 
From the same tomb comes a lid in two elements, each consisting of a lekanis decorated 
with (i) [a) female to 1., [b) bird to r. (PI. 67c); (ii) female heads [a) to 1., [b) to r. These are
present given the inventory numbers 26630 and 26637, but they fit together and are part of 
the same vase. The number 26630 belongs to a much larger lebes gamikos with a more 
elaborate lid, and it looks as if there had been some confusion, especially as 26630 seems to be 
missing (see below, p. 177, no. 382 and p. 222, no. 828). 

Skyphos (of Corinthian shape) 

156 Paestum 26632, from C. Gaudo (1972), T. 2. Ht. 19. 
[a) Draped woman with 'skewer of fruit' and fillet in 1. hand, mirror in r., [b) young satyr 
holding fillet in both hands. 

Of these the first three go very closely together and have several features in 

common. Among these we may note, in particular: (i) the presence of a woman who 

wears a long black chiton with a pink or red stripe down the centre, and decorated 

with small white dot-clusters, (ii) an Eros, with white-edged wings, the feathers of 

which are decorated with rows of black and white dots, (iii) the appearance of small 

white birds, (iv) the frequent use of'Asteas flowers', with a round white dot in the 

centre, of white palmette-fans, and on no. 154 of a white berried laurel-wreath, with 

alternate pairs of leaves curving downwards (as on nos. 135, 142-3). Note also the 

treatment of the rocks on no. 152 (cf. those on the two Cadmus vases, nos. 132 and 

141), the dotted stem of the palmette leaves on no. 152, the use of small white 

palmette-fans (no. 153; cf. also no. 154). More use is made than usual on smaller 

vases of added colours, especially white and orange-yellow, as well as black and 

various shades of red; this gives these three vases a bright and colourful appearance, 

and there is an unusually light-hearted look about them, especially in the scene on 

no. 154, where the boy offers a grasshopper to a most attractive looking hoopoe, with 

black and white crest, wings and tail (cf. no. 186). The papposilen on no. 152 is also 

drawn with a very lively look, and the rendering of the tufts of white hair on his 

body, partly as dots and partly as short lines, is unusual. In general treatment these 

three vases stand very close to Asteas and illustrate many of the characteristic 

features of his style and decorative patterns, but there are several new elements and I 

now incline to the view that they are not by the painter himself, but rather by a very 

close imitator in his workshop, who also painted the vases in sub-division (b), which 

are very closely associated with nos. 152-4. It is also noteworthy that two of t

three vases give us shapes we have not seen before�a phiale and a ring askos, both of 

which occur very rarely at Paestum. 

The other two vases (nos. 155-6) are minor works; the former is in very bad 

condition, but the speckled bird on the accompanying lid, with the circle of dots 

round its eye, the black stripes on wings and tail, and the black and white dots on its 

body will be seen again on many of the minor vases from this workshop. The 

drawing of the faces of the woman and the young satyr on the skyphos (no. 156) is in 

keeping with that of corresponding figures on nos. 152-4, and there is no particular 

reason why it should not be by the same hand, even though it does not illustrate any 

of the more distinguishing features of the other vases. 

(b) Other vases 

We may now consider a few other vases, most of which include in their design a 

woman draped in a black chiton with red and white decoration, very similar to those 

on nos. 152-4. This particular type of drapery is favoured at Paestum and is also 

used by Python and later painters; black garments appear elsewhere, especially in 

Campanian, but there they are mostly associated with funerary scenes. 

Hydria 

*157 Paestum 20210, from C. Licinella (1967), T. 10. Ht. 40. PLATE68a-c 
Eros, holding 'skewer of fruit" in r. hand and resting 1. hand on knee of woman seated on 
tendril, wearing black chiton with drapery over lower part of body, holding mirror in r. hand 
and wreath in 1. 
Below the handles: female heads. 

Here the seated woman corresponds very closely with her counterpart on no. 

152; she is draped in precisely the same fashion, with the lower hem of the black 

chiton just visible beneath the cloak over the lower part of her body; the Eros also 

matches those on nos. 152-3 and there can be little doubt that the hydria is by the 

same painter. The heads below the handles, however, are very much in the style of 

Asteas and are closely comparable to those on Karlsruhe B92 (no. 74 above) or on 

Paestum 21622 (no. 75). The three other vases from the same tomb (inv. 20211-3) 

are minor pieces from the Asteas-Python workshop, including a lekanis (no. 641 

below) representing a speckled bird with a dotted eye as on no. 155.

The first of these two cups (no. 158) comes from the same tomb as the large 

squat lekythos with the purification of Orestes (no. 142 above) and is of particular 

interest in that the visible flesh of the seated woman is shown in added white; this is 

rarely the case at Paestum, except for the faces of women in windows or in the later 

phase of the fabric (cf. the Painter of Naples 2585), though common enough in 

Campanian. She may well be Aphrodite, supported by Eros and Peitho, she wears a 

black chiton with central red stripe and is closely comparable to the other such 

women on nos. 152-3, except that her cloak is a little more elaborate, having a 

chequer border. In PAdd (p. 3) it was suggested that this cup might be by Asteas 

himself; there can be no doubt, however, that it belongs to the Black and Red 

Group. The bird in the exergue with its striped wings and white eye (cf. the hoopoe 

on no. 154) has a worm in its mouth; this is the first appearance so far of the typical 

Paestan 'early bird', of which we shall see many other examples in due course. 

The seated woman in the tondo of the second cup (no. 159) is closely 

comparable to the similarly draped woman on no. 152, although some of the white 

dots on her black chiton have now disappeared. She wears a beaded bandeau (cf. 

nos. 152-3, 157). Note also the palmette tendril with the 'Asteas flower' and the 

white fan-palmette in the exergue. 

The tomb (C. Andriuolo, 1969, T. 9) in which the cup was found is discussed by 

Angela Greco Pontrandolfo, who notes that the presence in it of an iron spear-head 

and knife might suggest an earlier date than the beginning of the second half of the 

fourth century, to which period the cup must belong, perhaps a little earlier than the 

more elaborate one from C. Gaudo. 

Lebetes gamikoi (fragmentary)

PAdd, no. A 35. 
[a) Upper part of two women, r. wearing black chiton, [b) part of nude woman. 

Both these lebetes gamikoi are in a very fragmentary state, but the presence on 

each of a woman wearing a black chiton with red collar and stripe suggests they are 

best placed here. The subject of no. 160 is unusual; it shows two nude boys, on a very 

much smaller scale than the woman standing beside them, playing the flute� 

perhaps a music lesson. The woman wears a long black chiton, the lower part of 

which emerges from beneath the piece of chequer-bordered drapery which runs 

across her body below the waist. On the reverse is a young satyr standing beside a 

woman wearing the usual peplos with a long overfall and a dot-stripe running 

vertically down it, shifting very slightly to the right on the overfall and again on the 

lower part. The pictures on both are framed between reserved bands; the superposed 

palmettes on no. 160 are very much in the manner of Asteas. As we shall see, the 

lebes gamikos is a very popular shape at this period and is mainly found in the tombs 

of women. With these two lebetes gamikoi we should look at a third, again ill-

preserved, but showing a somewhat similar treatment of the female figures and the 

drapery, though it does not seem to be by the same hand. 

*162 Paestum 21135, from C. Andriuolo (1969), T. 1. Ht. 16-5 PLATE 69 d 
[a) Draped woman resting 1. arm on Ionic pillar and holding infant in her hands, 
standing draped woman with chlamys over her shoulders, [b) Eros seated to 1. 
The lid is of lekanis type, with a tall knob, shaped like a flask. 

The scene on the obverse is not easy to interpret. Both women wear garments 

with long, patterned sleeves; the woman to right wears a red chitoniskos or ependytes 

over her chiton, and a similar red is used for the drapery wrapped around the infant. 

Over the chitoniskos is a crossed shoulder-cord (crrpoqnov, see Evelyn Harrison, in 

Festschrift Brommer, p. 156) of the kind often worn by Furies or Artemis as huntress. 

The infant holds in its left hand a long-necked bird (like a crane) which was 

originally painted on in white, but this has now largely disappeared. The costumes 

suggest a theatrical connection. 

The seated Eros on the reverse, with his strongly emphasised chin, finds 

parallels on many of the minor vases from the Asteas-Python workshop, and several 

other such vases (21136-8, 21143) were found with it, as well as a couple decorated 

in applied red (21142 and 21144).

Nude woman with hands in bowl, drapery on pillar; seated woman, wearing black tunic 
with red stripe, holding large cista; nude youth seated on rocks. 

There is the typical palmette with 'Asteas flower' between the figures. With this 

vase were found two minor vases (21556-7) from the Asteas-Python workshop (nos. 

798 and 515 below), a lebes gamikos (21560) by the Aphrodite Painter (Greco, P. di 

Afrodite, pi. 29) and a much restored hydria (21559) by the Caivano Painter. 

Perhaps also in this group should be placed the following neck-amphora, which 

was erroneously placed in PPSupp among the vases attributed to Python and then 

transferred to the Asteas Group as no. 133 a. The vase itself seems to have 

disappeared from sight and one has to depend on not very clear photographs taken 

many years ago. 

Neck-amphorae 

164 Once Nocera, Fienga coll. 
PPSupp, no 204 (corrected to 133 bis); LIMC III, p. 712, Elektra I 98, pi. 547, 2. 
[a) Stele scene�youth with drapery across lower part of body, holding fillet and phiale, 
resting 1. foot on base of stele, woman, wearing black chiton with cloak, resting r. hand, which 
holds a fillet, against the stele; above, 1. and r. female busts, [b) A3v, with stick in r. hand and 
egg in 1., + A2r, with fillet. 
Neck: [a) siren, holding cista with egg, [b) female head to 1. 

The scene on the obverse might be taken to represent the meeting of Orestes 

and Electra at the tomb of Agamemnon (cf. no. 144), but in the absence of any of the 

usual symbols which would serve to identify the youth (e.g. petasos) or the woman 

(e.g. hydria), it seems better to regard it as an ordinary funerary scene, especially as 

both of the figures are holding offerings. The woman wears a long black chiton, with 

a row of white beads down the sleeve (cf. the woman on the shoulder of no. 134 by 

Asteas) and a central red stripe; again the piece of drapery across her body leaves the 

bottom of the black chiton visible. Above are two female busts, one in each corner, 

but not immediately beside the top of the shaft, as are the Furies on nos. 142 and 144; 

there is no sign of snakes here, and the two are probably no more than onlookers, as 

we have often noted on the reverses of the larger vases. The neck depicts a siren, 

appropriate for a vase with a funerary theme, since the siren conveys the souls of the 

dead from this world to the next; they will figure fairly often on the necks of other 

amphorae and also as the sole design on smaller vases. 

The reverse shows two youths, one half-draped with a cloak covering the lower 

part of his body, the other fully draped. Both their cloaks have dot-stripe borders 

and they find parallels on some of the other neck-amphorae associated with Asteas in 

section 2 of this chapter (e.g. nos. 183^4). 

With the Nocera neck-amphora we should perhaps consider another, also now 

lost to sight, and recorded only in an old drawing: 

165 From Eboli. 
Greifenhagen, AA 1981, pp. 288 ff., no. 37, fig. 58; Guzzo, Citta scomparse, ill. on p. 174

(a) Youth bending forward by stele, beside which is a woman wearing a black chiton, 
[b) Air (2) +A2r. 
Neck: [a) siren, [b) female head. 

The scene on the obverse is very like that on the Nocera amphora, except that 

here the youth wears a pilos, which would increase the probability of identifiying 

him as Orestes, and the woman has her cloak drawn up over the back of her head to 

serve as a veil; nor are there busts above. A siren again appears on the neck of the 

obverse with a female head, now in profile to right, on the reverse. The two draped 

youths have been highly stylised in the drawing, but the one to right looks similar to 

his counterpart; we may note in the drawing the way in which the right leg of the 

youth to left appears very clearly through his cloak (cf. Pontecagnano 36525, no. 52 

above) and the same treatment is to be found on a third neck-amphora, which 

should perhaps also be placed here, though it more properly belongs to sub-division 

(c), since the woman does not wear a black chiton: 

*166 Madrid 11235 (L. 396). Ht. 37. (6)PLATE69� 
PP, no. 98, pi. 144 PPSupp, no. 83.

hand and phiale in 1., [b) Air, with egg, + A2r, with stick. 
Neck: [a) and [b) female head. 

The youth to left has a thick, plain black stripe as a border to his himation, 

which forms a large inverted V over the right shoulder, as on the slightly earlier bell-

krater Pontecagnano 36475 (no. 53 above; cf. also nos. 87-8) and on the Vatican 

phlyax bell-krater U 19 (no. 176 below). For this reason it seems preferable to 

associate no. 166 more closely with Asteas than Python. 

(c) Associated vases without the black and red drapery 

Here we may consider a few vases which go very closely in style with those in the two 

preceding sub-divisions but do not represent a woman wearing a black chiton with a 

red stripe (cf. no. 166). 

Kylikes

I. [a) Seated half-draped woman, with fillet and 'skewer of fruit' in r., dish in 1., 
[b) seated Eros, holding phiale. In the tondo, within a square reserved frame, is a female bust.

I. [a) Seated half-draped woman, holding cista and egg, [b) young satyr bending 
forward over r. foot, which rests upon a pointed amphora, and holding phiale in r. hand and 
thyrsus in 1. 

The kylix is not a common shape in Paestan, where the stemless cup is generally 

preferred. These two are similar in shape and decoration. There is a fairly tall stem, 

with a raised band about two-thirds the way down and a flat, disk-like foot. The 

exterior is decorated with r.f. laurel, and the tondo divided into two halves, with the 

figure in each separated by tendrils with 'Asteas flowers'. On no. 167 the centre is 

filled with the bust of a woman in a square, reserved frame; she has white flesh (as on 

no. 158) and what is visible of her chiton is red, with white dot-clusters. The two 

figures above and below use the top and bottom of the frame, as it were, for a seat. 

On the Madrid cup (no. 168) the tondo is bisected by a band of egg-pattern, in 

the correct sense below the satyr, but inverted for the seated woman, and thus 

producing a rather curious effect, which perhaps explains why this experiment does 

not seem to have been repeated. The young satyr is like the one on the phiale (no. 

153 above) and recurs in a very similar form on another vase, which must be placed 

here on grounds of style. 

Lekanis lid

PLATE 70 c 
Seated Eros with 'skewer of fruit' facing seated half-draped woman with cista; seated 
satyr with wreath and 'skewer of fruit'. 

Both the woman and the satyr are very similar to those on the preceding cup 

and we have again the typical palmette tendrils with 'Asteas flowers'; the wings of 

the Eros, from which the white edge has largely gone, also confirm the placing of this 

vase in the present context. 

The lekanis was found together with a cup (26654), a squat lekythos (26655) 

and a fish-plate (26651), all associated with the workshop of Asteas and Python (nos. 

391, 701 and 958 below) and a phiale (cf. no. 153 above, from T. 2) decorated in 

applied red with palmettes and ivy. 

Section 1 of this chapter dealt primarily with those vases by, or closely assoc

with Asteas, which were for the most part decorated with compositions on a larger 

scale, including a number with mythological subjects. The characters represented on 

these vases often wore more elaborate drapery than would normally appear on what 

may be called the 'standard' vases, where the decoration is usually confined to a dot-

stripe either running down the peplos or chiton or else serving as a border pattern. 

On these vases less use is made of added colours; they are mainly confined to 

adjuncts and to the small pieces of red drapery which appear across the bodies of 

women or of Eros, especially on the lebetes gamikoi. The vases fall broadly into three 

divisions, the first consisting of kraters and amphorae, mostly with two draped 

youths on the reverses, the second of lebetes gamikoi, usually with very elaborate 

lids, and decorated with scenes in which lavers play a prominent part, and the third 

of other shapes, generally decorated with scenes representing Dionysos and his 

followers or Eros. 

(i) Kraters and amphorae, mostly with two draped youths on their reverses 

Bell-kraters 

The bell-kraters listed below follow on closely from nos. 34 to 65 in Chapter IV, but 

wears a himation with a dot-stripe border, whereas on the earlier kraters the bo

consisted of a plain black stripe. In their poses there is little difference and almost all 

of them find close parallels on the earlier vases, as may be seen by comparing no. 170 

with nos. 43-6, no. 171 with nos. 55-7, no. 172 with nos. 36-8 (for the youth to 

right), no. 173 with nos. 54-7 and 59, no. 174 with nos. 43^t and 46, and no. 175 

with no. 43. One other recurring feature is also worth noting. It has already been 

pointed out that on nos. 35, 44, 46, 47, 59, 60 and 64 above there was a small 

squiggle, just above the dot-stripe border of the himation on the youth to right, to 

mark the termination of two diverging lines which descend from the left corner of the 

bracket-like line which marks the edge of the 'sleeve'; this is repeated on nos. 170^4 

below, and is particularly clear on no. 175, reappearing in almost identical form on 

the calyx-krater no. 181, which had previously been associated with Python, but 

must now be placed in this group, since it is almost impossible to separate their 

reverses. It will be seen again on the reverse of the neck-amphora in the M.S. 

collection in Geneva (no. 183), where the youth is particularly close to the one on no. 

175, and where both youths have dot-stripe borders to their himatia. The youths on 

nos. 170, 174-7 and 181-3 wear wreaths, as on nos. 37, 40-5, and 50 above. 

The scenes on the obverses add little to the repertory as illustrated on nos. 

43-65; no. 170 gives us a variant of no. 43, with a young satyr replacing Dionysos, 

no. 171 of no. 50, and no. 175 of no. 46. The bearded silen on no. 175 is very like the 

one on no. 137 above, and also on no. 184 below, another reason for associating this 

vase specifically with Asteas. 

More interesting are the vases with phlyax scenes, comparable to those on nos. 

36, 51, 63 and 64. On nos. 172-3 the phlyax is seen in three-quarter view; on his 

head he carries a large flat basket, filled with cakes in added white (barely visible on 

no. 173). Over his tights he wears a short white tunic, as also on no. 174, where there 

is a red jerkin beneath it, as on no. 36, 63 and 64. 

The pictures on all the bell-kraters are framed between the typical free-standing 

palmettes, without side-scrolls. 

Paestum 20198 (no. 173) comes from the same tomb near Agropoli that yielded 

the signed Stheneboia hydria (no. 134 above) and several other vases by Asteas (e.g. 

inv. 20161 = no. 150; 20201 = no. 185). The other phlyax krater (no. 172), from 

T. 147 in the Contrada Andriuolo (1970), was found with Campanian vases by the 

Painter of B.M. F 63 (inv. 24287 and 24293) and a plate (24281), decorated with ivy 

in added white and yellow.

The two bell-kraters in this sub-division, both representing phlyax scenes, stand

The Vatican krater is one of the finest of the unsigned works of Asteas, to whos

hand it had already been attributed by Zahn. The phlyax on B.M. F 188 (no. 26 

above) is a forerunner of Zeus, who has a similar beard. His tunic is of the same rich 

red colour as those of Gymnilos and Kosilos on the signed Berlin krater (no. 125), 

and his hose is treated in an almost identical manner; he has the aristocratically 

curved nose ypuTrov of Ajax on the Villa Giulia fragment (no. 130), 

and wears upon his head a tinsel crown as evidence of his high rank. He has a large 

phallus curvatus, taken by Dingwall to be the symbol of a dissipated life, which 

perhaps explains why the artist has corrected the phallus of Hermes, which had 

originally been drawn like that of Zeus, to the more usual pendant type. Hermes 

wears an orange petasos and a chlamys of the same colour flaps behind his back; in his 

left hand he holds the kerykeion, and in his right a tiny lamp to light Zeus on his 

way. Above, framed in the window, appears the object of Zeus's affections; she has 

white flesh, and wears a red chiton, patterned with white dot-clusters, exactly as on 

B.M. F 150 (no. 45; cf. also the head in the tondo of no. 167), and her fingers rest 

FR iii, p. 189; see also Rizzo in Dedalo 7, 1926, p. 414. 

Male lobulation, pp. 124, 132 and 136. 

upon the window-sill in the same way (cf. also nos. 133 and 139 for a similar 

treatment). On B.M. F 150 there was nothing to suggest she was other than a 

hetaira, but in the present context the suggestion that she might be Alkmene is 

attractive. 

On the reverse are two draped youths, the one to right with a plain bordered 

himation, draped over the right shoulder to produce an inverted V (as on nos. 53, 

87-8, and 166); the other's himation has a dot-stripe border. 

Madrid 11028 (no. 177) was originally assigned to Python, though in PP (p. 70) 

it was noted that there were differences between it and the other phlyax vases by that 

painter. A careful study of the vase itself, especially of its reverse, inclines me to think 

it is better placed with Asteas. The youths on the reverse both wear himatia with 

dot-stripe borders, but this is also the case with nos. 181 and 183, which are now 

attributed to Asteas; the half-draped youth on the left may be compared with those 

on nos. 59-62 for the pose and to the one on no. 170 for the drapery, and the draped 

youth to right with the one on no. 176. The phlyax with his white tunic over a red 

jerkin is very similar in pose to the one on no. 172 and the torch and situla he holds 

find counterparts on no. 174, but the leafy wreath round his head, with the two 

sprays which stick up almost like horns, is unusual. Parallels will be found on two 

Gnathia phlyax calyx-kraters, one in New York (51.11.2; formerly in the Matsch 

collection in Vienna = CVA, Germany 5, pi. 18; republished in VMG, p. 260, no. 

118, with bibliography), attributed by J.R. Green to the Compiegne Painter, the 

other in a Swiss private collection (Le Peintre de Darius et son milieu, pp. 244�5, colour 

ill. on p. 27), probably by the same hand; both show a phlyax, wearing a white tunic 

and holding a blazing torch, and may be dated to the third quarter of the fourth 

century, which would make them contemporary with the Madrid krater. 

Of the three kraters in this sub-division, the first (no. 178) is now lost to sight and is 

known to me only from a photograph of the obverse, which shows a young satyr 

bending forward over his raised left leg as on Naples 905 (no. 165), but looks to be 

rather later. I have not been able to get a photo of its reverse and thus cannot classify 

the youths upon it, so I place it in this group with some hesitation, rather than in the 

Altavilla Group, in which it was placed in PAdd. 

The other two (nos. 179-80) both have single figures only on their reverses, but 

in style belong to this group, especially no. 180 on which the phlyax should be 

compared with that on no. 174.

Calyx-krater 

*181 Paestum, from C. Laghetto (1955), T. 64. Ht. 30, diam. 28. PLATE7A-c,d 
PAdd, no. A 22, pi. 4 a; FA 10, 1955, p. 217, fig. 70; Sestieri, BdA 1956, pp. 71-3, figs. 1-3; 
Napoli, Paestum, fig. 15 (colour); BABesch 45, 1970, p. Ill, fig. 29; Rota and Fiammenghi, 
Paestum, p. 97, fig. 4. 
[a) Woman, with drapery across the lower part of her body, holding a mirror in her r. 
hand and resting her 1. on a laver, beside which stands a bearded silen, the reed of a flute in his 
r. hand and a 'skewer of fruit' in his ].; behind him, to r. a thyrsus, [b) Bv, with stick, 'skewer of 
fruit' and fillet, + A2r, with two eggs. 
From the same tomb come three r.f. vases from the Asteas-Python workshop, nos. 640 a, 
744 and 926, as well as three decorated in applied red (Appendix I, nos. 141, 148, 163). 

This is a vase of particular interest which, when it was first discovered, both 

Sestieri and I thought to be nearer to Python. The draped youth to right on its 

reverse, however, is so close to the corresponding one on no. 175 and also to that on 

no. 183 that it is impossible not to see them as the work of one painter. On all three 

we may note the presence of the squiggle above the lower border and an almost 

identical treatment of the himation. The parallel between the half-draped youth to 

left and that on no. 182 is also striking, and also with the one of Madrid 11028 

(no. 177). 

In shape the calyx-krater is not far from that of the Telephos krater (no. 128), 

with a similar foot, less elaborate than on no. 129. There is an ivy-pattern border 

beneath the obverse rim, changing to laurel on the reverse (as on nos. 125-8); the 

handle-zone is decorated on the obverse with white berried laurel and a central 

rosette (cf. the shoulder decoration on nos. 135, 142-3), and reverse wave on the 

other side. The scene on the obverse is framed between reserved bands with a white 

'capital' at the top (as on no. 136), and on the left the corner is turned into a triangle 

by the addition of a reserved stripe running upward at an angle of 45� from the 

framing band, and is decorated with a white rosette; it takes place on what looks like 

a stage floor, supported by a fluted Ionic column in the centre; the area between the 

column and the framing bands is decorated with inverted fan-palmettes, ivy-leaves 

and rosettes in added white. To the left of the scene is a tall white palmette tendril 

ending in an 'Asteas flower'. On the reverse there is a single framing palmette on the 

right side. 

The main scene shows a woman, with a piece of drapery across the lower part of 

her body, holding a mirror in her right hand and resting her left on the edge of a 

white laver. To right is a bearded silen, the reed of a flute is his left hand which also 

rests on the rim of the laver, a 'skewer of fruit' in his right. He is not unlike the silen 

on no. 175. That the scene takes place on what appears to be a stage is unusual for 

any but a phlyax vase; perhaps it is intended to suggest some connection with a 

comedy. 

Neck-amphorae 
(a)

PPSupp, no. 86 bis; ex Anderson Galleries, N.Y., Sale Cat. 26-9 Jan. 1921, p. 72, no. 470; 

ex Singleton Abbey (Lord Swansea coll.). 
[a) Eros with wreath, standing woman with wreath and cista, [b) A31, with stick and 
'skewer of fruit' + A2r, with fillet. 
Neck: [a) and [b) female head. 

The reverse of this amphora is closely comparable so that of no. 174. The wave 

and laurel patterns on the shoulder are repeated on no. 183. 

*183 Geneva, private coll. Ht. 43-5. PLATE 75 a, b 
Le Peintre de Darius et son milieu, p. 269-271 (ill.). 
(a) Draped woman, holding wreath and phiale, facing half-draped youth, bending 
forward over his r. foot which rests on a tendril, and holding sheathed sword in 1. hand, spear 
in r., with white pilos behind his head; above to r., bust of woman looking down, [b) Bv, 
leaning slightly forward on a stick, with 'skewer of fruit' and fillet in 1. hand, + A2r, with 
stick. 
Neck: [a) and [b) female head. 

The obverse of this vase raises problems of interpretation similar to those in 

regard to nos. 164 and 165 above. Here there is no sign of a funerary monument, but 

the youth with his sword, spear and pilos (as on no. 165), has a suggestion of Orestes. 

There is also a female bust in the upper right corner, which may be compared with 

those on no. 164, where there is an undoubted funerary connection, but another 

such will be found on Louvre K301 (no. 355 below), above a scene showing Eros 

and Aphrodite. It seems, therefore, difficult to read more into the scene on the 

Geneva amphora than a warrior and his consort, who makes appropriate offerings 

(phiale and wreath) to him, before his departure. 

There is no frame to the pictures on either side of this vase; they are separated 

(as on no. 184) by superposed palmette-fans. 

(*) 

The following neck-amphora appears to be a companion-piece to no. 183, though it 

has only a single figure on the reverse. 

* 184 Geneva, private coll. Ht. 46. PLATE 75 c, d 
[a) Draped woman with fillet in r. hand, phiale of eggs and white-dotted red fillet in 1., 
nude youth with wreath and red fillet in r., 'skewer of fruit' in 1., drapery over 1. arm; between 
them, a stele, [b) Eros striding to r., with white wreath in r. hand, cista in 1., drapery over 1
arm. 
Neck: [a) and [b) female head, wearing white-beaded kekryphalos. 

The Eros on the reverse should be compared with those on nos. 152-3 above. 

(ii) Lebetes gamikoi 

The lebes gamikos appears in the tombs of women at Paestum with increasing 

frequency from the end of the first half of the fourth century B.C. On the more 

elaborate examples considerable emphasis is given to the lid, which is often as tall as, 

or even taller than, the body of the vase itself and is made up of several different 

components. On a major vase (e.g. no. 185) these may number three or four and 

usually consist of (i) a lid like that of a lekanis, from which a stem rises to support (ii) 

a second lekanis with a lid, from which a second stem rises to support (iii) the bowl of 

a small lebes gamikos, which may itself have (iv) a plastic knob of some form. As 

these lids are composed of separable components, it is comparatively rare to find 

"See Angela Greco Pontrandolfo, Dial, di Arch. n.s. 1979/2, p. 37. 

them entire, and there is a strong tendency for individual sections to become 

separated from the lid to which they belong or even to be transferred to other vases 

with which they have no connection. A less elaborate, and more common, type of lid 

consists of a small lebes gamikos above joined by a stem to a lekanis-like lid; the 

upper portion is often decorated with female heads, the lower with human figures or 

birds and animals. All the lebetes have high upright handles which spring on either 

side from the shoulder of the body and are normally surmounted by simple knobs; 

beside the joins there are often plastic heads on the obverse and conical knobs on the 

reverse. These also seem very easily to become detached and lost. On the larger vases 

there is often a band of decorative pattern-work in added white on the shoulder of 

the obverse, and black tongue-pattern on the reverse; beneath the handles are 

various types of palmette decoration, once (on no. 185) with female heads, and once 

(no. 186) with birds. The smaller ones have less elaborate decoration, and a simple 

foot with a very low stem, as distinct from a much higher one, generally in two 

degrees, found on the others. 

The scenes represented upon the vases usually have some connection with 

bridal preparations, as may be seen from the frequency with which lavers appear; 

reserved bands serve as frames, not the typical Paestan palmettes.

no. 154), r. with mirror; white female head above, [b) woman with wreath and mirror, youth 
with stick and bead-wreath, beside a laver. 
According to Heydemann the lid was in two elements�below: [a) half-draped woman, 
with cista in r. hand, [b) siren; above: hound pursuing bird. It has, however, since 
disappeared. 

The first of these three impressive lebetes gamikoi, if indeed pretentious woul

not be a better description, comes from the same tomb as the Stheneboia hydria 

signed by Asteas (no. 134) and may be ascribed to his own hand. The goddess on the 

obverse, who wears a polos crown and very elaborate drapery, reminds us of the 

figures of Hera on the Judgment of Paris vases above (e.g. nos. 147-8 and 151), and 

a similar polos-crowned head appears above the fan-palmette below the left handle. 

The goddess on no. 185 may well be Aphrodite, though she is not normally shown 

wearing a polos in Paestan; she is associated with Dionysos in the hereafter, a theme 

dealt with in some detail by the late H.R.W. Smith in his Funerary Symbolism. 

The other two both show laver scenes on the obverse. On Madrid 11445 (no. 

186) a small Eros holding a white oenochoe and phiale, as if to pour a libation, 

stands with one foot on each side of the laver's rim; a wisp of red drapery, patterned 

with white dot-clusters, serves as a cache-sexe. To left a woman, nude save for a piece 

of drapery behind her thighs and over her left arm, holds up an egg in her right 

hand; on the other side is a half-draped woman seated on a white tendril, holding a 

mirror and a phiale. In the top corner a white bird (cf. nos. 152, 154) looks down 

from a window. The reverse is more mundane, with a seated woman and a young 

satyr standing before her, but the painter has excelled himself in the two birds 

perched above the fan-palmettes below the handles. One is a hoopoe with a splendid 

crest like that on no. 174; the other, which one would like to think of as a wood 

pecker, the companion of the hoopoe, is busily pecking at an 'Asteas flower'. Beside 

the handle-joins are plastic female heads wearing Phrygian caps (Amazons ?), here 

on both sides of the vase, as against only on the obverse of no. 185. 

The Naples lebes (no. 187) shows us three women around a laver; two are 

naked, the third, who is more or less a spectator, is fully draped and holds a white 

bird in her hand; another bird is perched on the base of the laver, and a third is 

drinking from a phiale held in the hand of the woman to left of the laver. Above, a 

small female head in white looks down in a detached manner upon the scene below. 

The draped woman bears a facial resemblance to some of the Hesperides on no. 135 

and her drapery is not unlike that of Hera on Brussels A 813 (no. 147). 

(*) 

On the two vases in this sub-division the lid took the form of a lekanis lid with a 

second lekanis on top of it, with a ridged stem between them. The lid of the lekanis 

on top has been lost from no. 189.

The body of this lebes is rounded, with two handles on each side, reaching up to

the visible flesh painted white, and on the reverse two conical knobs. The vase 

originally had a lid consisting of a flat cover for the mouth of the lebes, surmounted 

by a small lebes gamikos of normal shape, but this seems to have disappeared from 

sight, since it was no longer there when the vase was acquired by Leiden.

rendering of the seated woman and the Eros bending forward is very characteristic of 

the vases in this area, and the side tendrils of the palmette at the back, with their 

hooked leaves, remind us of the earlier vases.

The decoration of the inside of this kylix is most unusual, in that we have four

figures, three seated and one kneeling, grouped around the central tondo, which is 

surrounded by a reserved band, but left undecorated. The two scenes on the outside 

are framed between the standard palmettes. The figures in the tondo find many 

parallels on the preceding vases.

This cup is, as it were, a simplified and smaller version of no. 221, in which t

of the figures inside have been replaced by two large fan-palmettes, and the figures 

on the outside reduced from two to one. In style and treatment, however, they have 

much in common, especially the seated figures. On this vase it is difficult to be 

certain of their sex, but as their breasts are less pronounced and they both have short 

hair, it seems more likely that they are youths.

The first two cups go closely together. The subject of no. 223 is of interest, 

Dionysos is rarely to be seen mounted on a griffin, which is more usually ridden by 

Apollo. The papposilen behind presses both his hands on the griffin's rump as if to 

give him a forward push to start him on his way; in front a phlyax, wearing a short 

See the entry on p. 61 of the sale catalogue, where references are give to other representations. 

white tunic, holds up a blazing torch to light up the scene. Above Dionysos, a s

bird is perched in a window, painted white, and on top of his right hand is a circular 

object (looking rather like a target). Below the griffin a white feline bounds along, 

and in the exergue, separated from the main picture by a band of egg-pattern, a 

youth crawls to left on hands and knees, between two small palmette tendrils, that on 

the right ending in a 'Asteas flower'. The rim is decorated with berried laurel in 

added white. 

The Frankfurt cup (no. 224) shows a more familiar scene, with a seated half-

draped Dionysos facing a chubby Eros, who holds a red fillet in his left hand and 

stands, with the weight on his right leg, beside a small stele, a replica of which is 

beside Dionysos. The exergue is filled with a large speckled bird, with bands on wing 

and tail, and the typical circle of dots round its eye�perhaps a partridge. 

The cup in Westphalia is known to me only from the reproduction in the 

Exhibition catalogue, where Stahler (p. 252) associated it with Python. I should 

prefer to place it here, since the shape corresponds very closely to that of no. 223, the 

white hound in the exergue is comparable to the feline on no. 224, and the pattern-

work (ivy-wreath with incised stems round the rim) goes well with that on nos. 224 

and 226. The design should also be compared with that on Paestum 4807 (no. 158), 

on which there is also a good deal of added white, and similar pattern-work. The 

treatment of the two women (who may be Aphrodite and Peitho) is also very much 

in the manner of Asteas, as are the wings of Eros, with their white edges and black 

and white dots on the feathers. 

The cup in Malibu is simpler, with only a seated nude woman, holding a 

'skewer of fruit' in one hand and a mirror in the other above a small stele like those 

on no. 224. The exergue has disappeared, but the dividing band of egg-pattern is as 

on nos. 223-4 and the white ivy with incised stems round the rim as on nos. 224�5. 

The laurel on the outside runs to left instead of to right, as on the other three, but the 

treatment of the foot and stem is similar. 

In his study of the Oxford bell-krater (no. 235 below) in AJA 48, 1944, p. 361, 

Beazley pointed out that it must be by the same hand as Cambridge GR7. 1943 

(no. 236; at that time lost to sight and known only from pis. 119-20 in the Museum 

Disneianum) and that it was a product of the workshop of Asteas and Python. In PP 

it was noted (p. 72) that the obverse of the krater now in Cambridge 'has decided 

affinities with the work of Asteas (cf. Madrid 11054 and 11058; B.M. F 153 = nos. 

62, 60 and 41 above), but the draped youths on the reverse are more in Python's 

manner.' Beazley went on to refer to several other vases with reverses comparable to 

those of the Oxford and Cambridge kraters and drew the conclusion that 'the design 

of our two reverses was not confined to one artist but was common property, as 

might be expected, of the school'. His statement underlines one of the main problems 

in sorting out the vases by the different artists who were members of the Asteas-

Python workshop; they must have been comparatively limited in number, and they 

were obviously all very well drilled. A few new personalities have begun to emerge 

(see Chapter VIII), but it now seems likely that the Altavilla Painter, named after 

the find-spot of one of his amphorae in Salerno (no. 227), is not one of them and that, 

in the light of a fuller study of the reverses of the vases attributed to him, some of 

these are more probably by Asteas (e.g. nos. 8, 20, 38-9, 43-4, 48, 55, 87-9), since 

the draped youths on their reverses all have himatia with the plain black borders 

typical of that painter's work, and others (e.g. nos. 279, 301-2) look closer to Python. 

There remains a third group, in which the vases, as suggested in PP, have some of the 

characteristics of both painters; these are discussed in this section, and it now seems 

likely that they represent the earlier work of Python, when he was still strongly under 

the influence of Asteas and had not yet reached the stage at which his draped youths 

assume the appearance that is so characteristic of his mature work (cf. Fig. 5), as 

exemplified on nos. 275, 279-81, 284-5 below. It is interesting to note that Beazley 

(loc. cit.) cites the Reading vase (no. 275; then known to him only from the drawings 

in Passeri, pis. 123�4) as a parallel for its reverse design to those on the Oxford and 

Cambridge kraters (nos. 235-6); the actual vase shows that the drawing is more 

assured and the dot-stripe borders more strongly emphasised, but it does lend 

support to the attribution of the other vases to an earlier stage in Python's career. 

It should be noted that, with the exception of no. 227, on all the other vases in 

this section both of the draped youths on the reverses have dot-stripe borders to their 

himatia. As we have already seen, with Asteas a plain black stripe is standard in the 

earlier phase, moving to one plain and one dot-stripe border later on (as no nos. 

170-6, 182), and only very rarely do both youths have dot-stripe borders (e.g. nos. 

139a, 177, 181, 183). A very minor distinguishing feature between the later vases of 

'Of the other three kraters in Beazley's list, Louvre K 247 (no. 231) must belong to the same group 

as the Oxford and Cambridge kraters; Agrigento, Giudice 193 (no. 46), seems to me essentially the 

work of Asteas since, although the youths on the reverse are in a similar pose to those on nos. 230 and 

231, their himatia are rendered in typical Asteas fashion with plain black borders, and the drawing of 

their heads is quite different; B.M. F 154 is by the Boston Orestes Painter, who was a pupil of Python 

and undoubtedly modelled the draped youths on its reverse on those of some of his master's later vases. 

Asteas and those listed below may be seen in the presence on the former (e.g. nos. 

171-5, 181-3) of a small U-shaped mark on the himatia of the youths on the right 

(Type A3), just about where the navel would be, which is completely absent on nos. 

227-238. It therefore looks as if Python's career begins towards the mid-point of that 

of Asteas; at first his use of the dot-stripe border on his reverses is rather tentative, 

but becomes much more positive as his style progresses. This chronology would fit in 

well with his two signed vases, which look to be contemporary with the Phrixos 

krater and the two vases in San Antonio signed by Asteas. 

Two neck-amphorae in Salerno, neither in very good condition, provide a 

connecting link between the work of Asteas and the bell-kraters formerly attributed 

to the 'Altavilla Painter'. 

Neck-amphorae 

*227 Salerno, Mus. Prov., from Pontecagnano. Ht. 42-5. PLATE 84a, b 
Patroni, VP, figs. 52-3; PPSupp, no. 80, pi. 10*. 
[a) Nude youth, wearing pilos, bending forward in front of standing draped woman, 
holding sreath, [b) A3r, with 'skewer of fruit', + A2r. 
Neck: (a) female head, [b) bird.

PPSupp, no. 79, pi. 10 a; Patroni, VP, figs. 40-1. 
(a) Nude youth, with phiale in 1. hand, drapery over both arms, standing draped 
woman, holding cista in 1., [b) A31 + A2r; between them, a palmette. 
Neck: [a) and [b) female head. 

The first is exceedingly close in style to the later bell-kraters and neck-

amphorae associated with Asteas in the preceding chapter (e.g. nos. 170-83), and 

indeed it is with very considerable hesitation that I have transferred it to the present 

section. The draped youth to left is comparable with his counterparts on Dublin 

1880-505 (no. 170), and on the calyx-krater in Paestum (no. 181), where the 

himation has exactly the same interrupted dot-stripe on the right-hand side; the 

youth to right, whose himation has a plain border, is near to those on nos. 171-2; the 

design on the obverse is also very similar to that on no. 170, with the positions of the 

two figures reversed. On the other hand it is very difficult to separate no. 227 from 

no. 228, since the standing draped women on the two vases are remarkably alike, as 

are the draped youths on the left; the two youths on the latter are also close to those 

on nos. 229-30. While the possibility that these two amphorae should find a place in 

the preceding chapter is not to be excluded, it seems at the moment preferable to put 

them here as marking the transition between Asteas and Python and showing us the 

first stage in what are to become the typical Python draped youths. It is interesting 

to note also that on no. 227 the head and bird depicted on the neck of the obverse 

and reverse are shown in small rectangular panels, with a considerable area above 

left in plain black. A similar device appears on the neck-amphora Naples SN 76 DG 

(no. 354 below), and a modification of it, in which the panel-frames are omitted, on 

nos. 353 and 357. The heads on the neck of no. 228 should be compared with those 

on nos. 347, 349, 352, 354 and 357. 

Bell-kraters 

The draped youths on the reverses of the bell-kraters listed below link them closely to 

no. 228. Python has a slight preference for Type A3 for his youths on the left�i.e. the 

himation is draped to leave a V-shaped opening at the neck, the body is shown in 

almost frontal view, the left hand projects slightly outward beneath the drapery, and 

may hold a stick, which emerges at a slight angle, and the head, shown in profile to 

the right, has a downward tilt (e.g. nos. 229-236). The dot-stripe borders are not 

quite so strongly emphasised as they are on the later vases (e.g. nos. 270 ff.) and the 

dots tend to look rather triangular (especially on nos. 229-232). The youth to right is 

generally of Type A2, with the right hand exposed, and on nos. 230-2, 235-6 he 

holds a stick in his left hand, which is concealed by the drapery. Nos. 233-4 show a 

variation in that the youth to left also has a V-drape like the other. Slight variations 

also occur in the dot-stripe border on the himation of the youth to left, which may 

appear only on the bottom hem (as on nos. 229 and 231), or run down the right-

hand side from below the concealed left hand to join the hem at the bottom (as on 

nos. 230, 232-6). Except on no. 233 the youths wear leafy wreaths in added white. 

The rather heavy heads of the youths on Louvre K247 (no. 231) find later 

counterparts on vases like nos. 284 and 285. 

The obverse designs are invariably Dionysiac and two have a specific connec 

tion with the theatre�on no. 230 there is a female mask (Type S) suspended above 

the two figures, and on no. 238 Dionysos is shown with a phlyax actor, wearing the 

usual short white tunic over his red jerkin and tights, but also a chlamys fastened by 

a brooch at the neck and a petasos behind his head, which suggest that he is 

probably intended to represent Hermes. The reverse, somewhat exceptionally, 

represents a draped youth, of rather solid aspect as on no. 231, but posed more as on 

no. 227, together with a draped woman, again very like the one on no. 227. We may 

also note the small, bearded silen on nos. 229 and 233, and the young satyrs on nos. 

235-6, since they will reappear on some of the later vases (e.g. nos. 261, 270, 301-2, 

309, 311; 264, 301, 303, 334, and also with those on the reverses of the two signed 

vases, nos. 239-40), as do the Pan-satyrs (with small goat horns) on nos. 231 and 237 

(cf. nos. 255, 333). 

In size, shape and pattern-work the bell-kraters are very consistent; all are 

between 32 and 37 cm. in height, with a cylindrical body curving downwards to a 

short stem and a fairly solid foot, with a grooved upper edge; below the rim is a laurel 

wreath to right, below the pictures wave-pattern in black on a reserved band, with 

reserved bands above and below it; the scenes on both sides are framed between the 

standard palmette-scrolls, sometimes with a white dot in the central spiral (as on nos. 

229, 233, 236, 238).

The B.M. krater is one of the most famous of all Paestan vases and represents 

the story of Alkmene; this is comparatively rarely represented in Greek vase-

painting and is probably best known to us from the Amphitruo of Plautus, although 

the version given here probably owes something to the drama by Euripides, in which 

a Zeus-sent storm seems to have played a prominent part. The vase shows Alkmene 

seated upon the altar in an agonised appeal to Zeus to save her from the wrath of 

Amphitryon, who is trying to dislodge her by lighting a fire beneath her. Zeus 

answers her prayers, first by hurling two thunderbolts, and then, since that method 

did not prove effective, by bidding the Clouds quench the flames with water. The 

artist has compressed the scene somewhat, since the pile of wood is not yet lighted, 

though the water is already pouring down on to it. 

The scene is divided into two registers, separated by a wavy ground-line in 

white, with dot-clusters above it at intervals, and, at the points where this line meets 

the reserved bands which frame the picture, small inverted white palmette-fans. The 

two corners of the upper register are occupied by busts of Zeus (IEYZ) and Eos 

(AQZ) , between them are the two Clouds, pouring down water from two hydriai to 

quench the flames of the pyre and thus creating a magnificent arched rainbow 

behind Alkmene; it reaches to the top of the picture, and is filled with white 

representing drops of rain. Both the Clouds wear red chitons, patterned with white 

It appears as no. 119 in the inventory of the vases of the Museo Nuovo in Naples, 1796. It was 

acquired between then and 1805 (since it does not figure in the catalogue of that date) by the fifth Earl 

of Carlisle [d. 1825) for his collection at Castle Howard, whence in 1890 it passed to the B.M. See 

JHSXO, 1890, p. 225, pi. 6. 

The most recent lists of the representations of Alkmene in South Italian vase-painting will be 

found in Schauenburg, AuA 10, 1961, p. 87; Brommer, Gottersagen, p. 44, and in LIMC I, p. 554; to the 

vases there noted should now be added a remarkable Apulian calyx-krater by the Darius Painter, at 

present on the U.S. market. The obverse shows Alkmene in the centre, seated upon an altar, with a 

nimbus around her; in front of and beside the altar are logs of wood. On the left is a youth with 

Amphitryon, both holding torches; to right a youth comes up and behind him is a bearded man 

(KPE&N). Above to left a boy stands beside the seated figure of the blind seer Teiresias; the eagle of Zeus 

flies above Alkmene; and to right are Hermes, Eros and Aphrodite. The principal figures are identified 

by inscriptions. 

Cf. Plautus, Rudens 86: non ventus ... verum Alcumena Euripidi, and on the passage see Otto 

Skutsch, CR 81, 1967, pp. 11-12. 

The presence of Eos may be explained as a reference to Zeus's order that the dawn should be 

delayed, or else she merely indicates the time when the action was taking place (Robert, Arch. 

Hermeneutik, p. 278; Sechan, p. 243, note 4). 

 Formerly restored to represent amphorae, but their true shape emerged when the vase was 

cleaned. A similar use of water poured from hydriai to quench the flames of a pyre may be seen on 

various vases showing the apotheosis of Herakles (see Brommer, Herakles II, pp. 93-4); the best South 

Italian examples are two volute-kraters, one by the Lycurgus Painter (Milan, 'H.A.' coll. 260 = CVA 1, 

IV D, pis. 7-9; RVAp I, p. 417, no. 16/13), the other by the Underworld Painter [RVAp, Suppl. I, p. 85, 

no. 287 a), which shows two women with hydriai running up to the pyre. 

dots. In the centre of the lower register Alkmene sits upon the altar, her legs dangling 

over the pyre in front of it, her right arm upraised in entreaty to Zeus; she reminds us 

a little of the heroine in a grand opera, where the role is played by a mature prima 

donna. To left and right are Antenor and Amphitryon, applying lighted torches to 

the pyre. The altar is carefully drawn with a triglyph-metope frieze and side fenders, 

so is the pyre with rows of logs, laid alternately sideways and frontwards. The 

drapery of the three principal figures is elaborately patterned and we may note 

especially the use of small b.f. fan-palmettes for borders, as well as wave (Antenor) 

and white dots on a black stripe (Amphitryon). All three are heavy-looking; the 

shoulders of the two men are too narrow and rounded, their legs rather dispropor 

tionately long from knee to foot, their arms short and pudgy; those of Amphitryon 

look as if made of rubber. The nose is long and straight, the chin well defined, and 

the eye, which is rather more deeply set than with Asteas, is shown by three almost 

parallel lines above the pupil, with a smaller line for the lower lid. 

On the reverse is a Dionysiac scene of much the same sort as those which figured 

on the vases of Asteas. It is divided into two registers�below, Dionysos between two 

maenads; above, two half-length figures of young satyrs and a three-quarter length 

one of Pan, who raises both his arms in a gesture of surprise. The maenad on the left 

perhaps owes something to the similar one on Asteas's signed krater in Madrid; the 

vertical stripe of wave-pattern, however, is an innovation. Dionysos obviously owes a 

good deal to the work of Asteas, but there is a difference in the actual drawing, 

especially of the head, in the treatment of the hair and the eye. The hair of Asteas's 

male figures generally falls on to the shoulder in a solid mass, with perhaps a few 

individual curls sketched in at the edges; with Python the mass tends to break up into 

a number of separate locks of hair, which fall in a rather mat-like formation down on 

to the front side of the shoulder (cf. also nos. 230, 233, 238). Asteas also has a better 

feeling for the natural form of the body. 

The light, transparent drapery of the maenad on the right is less common in 

Paestan than in Apulian; it will also be seen on no. 257 and is thought probably to 

have been made from the silk-like material woven from the filaments (beards) with 

which certain types of mussels attached themselves to rocks, it was widely used at 

Tarentum. Also of interest is the curious way in which her hair is dressed, with a long 

lock falling down from just above the forehead, as on the Apulian oenochoe B.M. 

F 101 ; it may have some ritual significance or represent a local fashion. 

The inscriptions are all incised, and the letters resemble those used by Asteas, 

except that the second upright stroke of N comes down to the same level as the first, 

instead of stopping a little short of it, the tail of Y is much longer, and the top of Q 

more pointed. On the whole they are closest to those on the Madrid krater. The 

handle on the right was repaired in antiquity with a piece of lead; Zahn has 

ingeniously suggested that this might have taken place as a result of the journey 

occasioned by the export of the vase from Paestum. 

The date would seem to be about contemporary with the Phrixos krater of 

Asteas (no. 126); it is clearly later than the Cadmus krater, because of the more 

developed shape, the difference in the treatment of the drapery, and the greater use 

made of colours. A comparison between the drapery and pose of the maenad to left 

on the reverse of the Phrixos krater and that of the maenad on Python's vase 

'See Pliny, N.H. ix, 137; Noel Oakeshott in Studies Trendall, p. 6, note 13. 

RVAp II, p. 612, no. 21/68, pi. 235,2; Lohmann, Grabmdler, no. A328, pi. 3,1. 

furnishes another argument in favour of this dating, and the vase must belong to the 

latter part of the third quarter of the fourth century. 

The second signed vase comes from Tomb 24 in the 1969 excavations in the 

Contrada Andriuolo at Paestum, and was found together with a kylix (21369) which 

has been attributed to Python (no. 248 below) and a phiale (21368) by the Painter of 

Wurzburg H5739, a close colleague and imitator. The paintings which decorated 

the walls of the tomb are in poor condition; three sides had foliage and pomegran 

ates, the fourth (east) a warrior and a horse as well, in the pediment. In shape the 

vase is a tall neck-amphora with horizontally ribbed handles and a foot in two 

degrees. It differs considerably from the amphora signed by Asteas (no. 133), which 

was of unusual form, and has the normal cylindrical neck, flat shoulder and tapering 

ovoid body. The signature is boldly painted in black (FTYGfiN EI~PA<t>E) on the base 

of the altar on which the egg is standing. The vase has been recomposed from 

fragments; not much is missing, but some of the added colour has now disappeared. 

The scene on the obverse is again in two registers divided by a white ground-

line. In the centre is an altar in front of an Ionic column, which reaches to the top of 

the picture; the front of the altar is decorated in added colour with a quadriga 

(reminiscent of those on the walls of some of the painted tombs) on a black 

background, above which is a frieze of white dentils. Between the two side-fenders on 

the top of the altar stands a large egg, from which the infant figure of Helen 

(hEAENH) is emerging, her arms extended towards her mother Leda (AHAA), who 

runs up to her from the left, with arms outstretched in a gesture of welcome. On the 

other side, the white-haired Tyndareus (TYNAAPEYZ), plucks at his beard with his 

right hand, as if somewhat puzzled, if not worried, by the event that has taken place. 

Both wear elaborate drapery and Leda has a polos-crown. In the upper level are four 

busts, two on each side of the column. In the left corner is Hermes (hEPMAZ), with 

petasos and caduceus, then Aphrodite (AOPOAITH); to the immediate right of the 

column is Phoibe (O. IBA) and in the corner a papposilen inscribed TYBPQN. 

Phoibe was another daughter of Tyndareus and Leda, and thus the elder sister of 

Helen, although little reference is made to her in literature and art. The white-

haired papposilen, with his fawn-skin and thyrsus, is a very familiar figure on 

Paestan vases, but this is the first time he has been identified, though the name is not 

found elsewhere. 

The reverse shows a half-draped Dionysos, seated between a young satyr and a 

maenad, with the bust, above, of another maenad about to beat a tambourine. The 

figure of Dionysos finds a counterpart on no. 229 above and is repeated on many of 

the later vases (e.g. nos. 255, 263, 268, 273-4, 292); the maenad may be compared 

with the one on no. 228 and, closer still, on no. 308 below. 

On the neck of the obverse is a siren; her right hand holds up a phiale, from 

which a small white bird is drinking (cf. no. 187 by Asteas); her left, a tambourine. 

Beside her to left is a palmette-tendril with an 'Asteas flower'. On the other side is a 

female head, with a touch of pink on the cheek, wearing a bandeau edged with white 

Corrigan, Tomb-paintings, pp. 585�6. 

'"Euripides [Iph. Aulis, 50) refers to her as one of the three daughters of Leda, and Ovid [Her. 8, 

77-8) as the sister of Clytemnestra. It is clear, therefore, that Phoibe was known in antiquity as Helen's 

sister, and she appears, inscribed (DOIBA, along with the Dioskouroi and Helen, on an Attic b.f. hydria 

of the Archippe Group, on loan to the Antikenmuseum in Basel (D. von Bothmer, AntK 12, 1969, 

pp.26ff., pis. 17-18). 

beads. Below the handles are superposed fan-palmettes, with scrolls on each side at 

the top, similar to those on nos. 68 and 71 by Asteas. Both vases have meanders with 

chequers below the pictures on the obverse, and wave-pattern on the reverse, a 

combination not used by Asteas. 

The figures on the obverse are comparable to those on the Alkmene krater, and 

the two provide excellent illustrations of the extremely close connection between the 

work of Asteas and Python. 

can be attributed to Python and which are closest in style and treatment to his two 

signed vases. 

We may begin wtih the Cadmus krater in the Louvre, which is of particular 

interest since it challenges comparison with the two vases representing the same 

subject, one signed by Asteas (no. 132) and the other attributed to him (no. 141).

young satyr with thyrsus and wreath, [V) draped woman, holding egg in 1. hand, between 
half-draped youth (Br) and Pan-satyr, holding egg and fillet. 

In shape the vase stands between the San Antonio and Malibu kraters by 

Asteas, with a foot higher than that of the former, less elaborate than that of the 

latter. Below the rim is a wreath of berried ivy on the obverse, and of laurel on the 

reverse; the handle-zone on the front is decorated with a fan-palmette, scrolls and 

flowers in added white, and with plain meanders on the back. The main picture is 

framed between reserved bands on the obverse and 'standard' palmettes, with a 

small additional scroll at the top, on the reverse; a good deal of added colour (white, 

orange-yellow and red) is used. We may note that immediately below the Cadmus 

scene is a band of'dentils', which recalls the use of this pattern in Sicilian," while on 

the reverse there is a reserved zone, not unlike a stage floor, as on the Maron krater 

in Lipari (LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 275, no. 46 g). 

In the centre is Cadmus, a pointed amphora in his left hand, a stone in his right 

ready to hurl it at the serpent which is coiled beside a tall pile of stones and a tree, 

which represent the spring and the rock. The two richly draped women on either 

side and the one seen at half-length above, holding a mirror, are probably Thebe, 

Dirke and Ismene (or Krenaia), as on the two Asteas vases; Hermes appears as a bust 

in the top left corner (cf. no. 240) and to right above the rock are busts of Pan and a 

young satyr, who holds a thyrsus and a wreath. 

On the reverse is a draped woman between a half-draped youth and a nude 

Pan-satyr. 

The drawing and the drapery are very much in Python's manner; especially in 

"E.g. on the Lloyd krater, Oxford 1937.283 [ = LCS, no. 89), Syracuse 48637 (no. 90),

regard to the two women below, with the touch of red on their cheeks, the rounded 

breasts (cf. Alkmene), and the fussy treatment of the peplos below the waist (cf. the 

woman to right on the reverse of no. 240). The rendering of the dot-stripe border of 

the cloak of the woman on the reverse will find a close parallel on the vases of the 

Painter of Wurzburg H5739, a close follower of Python, while that of the youth to 

left is repeated on some of the later Python bell-kraters (e.g. Richmond 82.15, Berlin 

4532; nos. 271-2 below). 

Closely connected with the above are two small fragments of calyx-kraters.

Head of a swan, above which is the inscription TANYMH AHZ. 

Analogy of style with the preceding vase places the Bari fragments (no. 242) 

here rather than with the work of Asteas. The drapery of Hypsipyle has similar 

patterns to that of Alkmene; the hair of Opheltes is done in the typical manner of 

Python and the scene is taking place above the same row of 'dentils' as on the 

Cadmus krater. The pale buff colour for the body of the child and for the mouth of 

the well is unusual; it reappears on the body of the sphinx on no. 288. The use of 

shading on the body of the hydria to suggest volume is of interest; it is used in similar 

fashion for the vase carried by Pan on Richmond 82.15 (no. 271). The subject is 

quite clear; it is the serpent devouring the young Opheltes, later to be renamed 

Archernoros, while his nurse Hypsipyle runs off to get help. This is the only extant 

vase showing the actual moment of his death, but the story is recorded on several 

Apulian vases.

Here also should probably be placed a small fragment, once in Berlin, but 

apparently lost after the second world war, and therefore no longer possible to check; 

it represents the head of a swan, encircled by a nimbus, and the inscription 

TANYMHAHZ. It must refer to the rape of Ganymede, although there seems to be no 

literary authority for his being carried off by a swan instead of an eagle. However, a 

swan appears in connection with the events preceding the rape or as the rapist on at 

least six Apulian vases, and this suggests a possible local variant of the myth in 

Notably on three volute-kraters�Leningrad 1714 [ = RVAp I, p. 416, no. 16/12); Louvre K66 

[=RVAp II, p. 913, no. 28/36); Naples 3255 [RVAp II, p. 490, no. 18/42). See LIMC II, p. 474, with 

illustrations on pis. 357-8. 

 On the subject in general see H. Sichtermann, Ganymed (1953), and, with particular reference to 

South Italian vase-painting, K. Schauenburg in Opus Nobile (Festschrift Ulfjantzen, 1969), pp. 131-7, 

where the name vase of the Ganymede Painter is illustrated on pi. 21. It shows Ganymede carried off by 

a swan [RVAp II, p. 795, no. 25/1, pi. 294) on the neck of the obverse, and a similar scene appears on a 

lost vase formerly in the Fenicia collection in Ruvo (Sichtermann K373) and on an earlier volute-

krater in a private collection in Bari [RVAp II, p. 468, no. 17/60a, pi. 167,5). Other Apulian vases 

showing the scene before the rape are: (1) situla, Tampa Museum, ex J. V. Noble coll. [RVAp I, p. 405,

which a swan replaced the eagle, or perhaps there was some confusion with the story 

of Hyakinthos, who is often shown on Greek vases riding on a swan. 

Mention may perhaps be made here of another calyx-krater, Naples 1983 (inv. 

82259; ht. 49; PAdd, no. A 47), which represents on the obverse a combat scene and 

on the reverse Dionysos between a maenad and a bearded silen. The vase has been 

almost completely overpainted and very little of what is visible on it today is ancient, 

but the reverse suggests that the original might have been by Python or close to him 

in style. 

Bell-kraters 

Python decorated a large number of bell-kraters, most of which have two 

draped youths on their reverses and are dealt with in section 4. Here we must 

consider a few of rather larger dimensions and with other designs on their reverses. 

Of these the best known is certainly the Orestes krater in the B.M., which is closely 

comparable in shape, decoration, style and composition with the signed Alkmene 

krater.

This vase was formerly in the Hope collection (Tillyard, no. 267, p. 138, pi. 36), 

whence it passed in 1917 to the British Museum. In the centre of the obverse is the 

Delphic tripod; in front of it is the omphalos, on which Orestes is kneeling, a short 

sword in his right hand and two spears in his left. On the left stands Athena, wearing 

a crested helmet with two tall plumes, and the aegis over very elaborate drapery; on 

the right is Apollo, holding the lyre and standing beside a laurel tree on the branches 

of which hang fillets and votive tablets. One Fury, winged, stands beside him, 

another appears as a menacing bust above the tripod; in each corner is a bust, to left, 

a woman wearing a tall stephane with a veil, often interpreted as Clytemnestra, but, 

in the light of Paestum 4794 (no. 142), more probably Leto, the mother of Apollo, 

and to right a youth wearing a pilos and carrying a spear, probably Pylades. The 

whole scene seems to reflect a strong dramatic influence, though it can be referred to 

no specific scene of the Oresteia, and, as Prag (op. cit., pp. 49 ff.) points out, the very 

presence here of Athena is 'proleptic of the next act in the story'. He also plausibly 

identifies the object upon which she rests her left foot as the 'stone of Injury' rather 

than simply an inverted capital. 

Winnefeld (Bonner Studien, p. 171) attributed the vase to Asteas, Hauser and 

Watzinger (FR iii, p. 60, note 2 and p. 372, note 2) to Python; Tillyard (p. 139) gave 

On Hyakinthos see H. Sichtermann in Jdl 71, 1956, pp. 97 ff., where a detail from the volute-

krater Naples 3252, showing Hyakinthos (not Ganymede) on the swan, is illustrated on p. 106, fig. 11. 

An unpublished Campanian bell-krater by the Ixion Painter in a private collection in Naples shows the 

same scene. Brommer VL pp. 526-8 gives a list of the vases representing Hyakinthos, but includes no 

it to neither directly, but considered it closer to the style of the latter. I would have 

little hesitation in giving the vase to Python, as it seems to me closely comparable to 

the two signed vases, its reverse being particularly close to that of the amphora (no. 

240). There is the long, straight nose with the deep-set eyes (cf. especially Pylades, 

who in this respect resembles Antenor), the same elaborate drapery with the fine 

fold-lines in thinned glaze, and the same treatment of the hair, which falls in a mat 

like series of locks down on to the shoulders. The three figures on the lower register of 

the reverse will all reappear on other unsigned vases. We may also note the half solar 

disk above the picture, as on no. 241 (cf. also no. 350 below). 

Like the two signed vases, the Orestes krater bears witness to Python's fondness 

for a plentiful use of added colours�shades of yellow and orange, white, red and 

purple�which give the obverse a lively look. Its surface, however, is far too crowded 

and the composition is poor. The figures are clumsily placed; the Fury on the right 

has hardly room to stand and her wings look quite absurd; Orestes looks as if he had 

been pinned on to the omphalos, and the drawing of Apollo's legs is unconvincing. It 

is Python in his more pretentious vein and it perhaps deserves Beazley's designation 

of it as a 'monstrosity'. 

Another bell-krater is perhaps rather more successful than the Orestes krater; it 

had a long and interesting history before it came to rest in the Vatican.

papposilen, and satyr-boy with thymiaterion and ladle; above�three comic masks (phlyax,

The picture is framed on both sided by reserved bands, as on the Alkmene and Orestes 
kraters. 

The centre of the main scene shows a couch, with red cushions and a red drape 

hanging down in front of it, on which recline three banqueters, half-draped in 

patterned garments typical of Python, and enjoying a game of kottabos after the 

feast. All wear ivy-wreaths and have long hair. In front of the couch to left is a girl, 

with white flesh, wearing an orange-brown chiton, and playing the flute. Opposite 

to her on the right comes up a satyr-boy, holding a cyathus and what looks like a 

thymiaterion, though much of it is now worn away. In front of the couch lies a 

sleeping papposilen, still holding the two reeds of a flute in his hand. He may well be 

an actor dressed up as a papposilen, since the lines at his wrist and ankles suggest 

that he is wearing a stage costume. He should be compared with his counterpart on 

no. 230, where he stands in front of Dionysos holding a cithara, and where there is 

also, as on the Vatican krater, a mask suspended above, which reinforces the stage 

connection. Above the banqueters runs a white ivy-trail, a decorative motif to which 

Python is most partial, from which are suspended three comic masks, a female one

(Type SS) seen in frontal view, between those of two phlyakes, one with white hair 

and beard (Types B and A). 

A game of kottabos is in progress, not in the simpler form we have seen on nos. 

37, 50 and 62 by Asteas, but the one which was played with a tall stand. The central 

banqueter would appear to have made his throw and has now transferred his cup to 

his left hand in order to leave the other free to make that sweeping gesture intended 

either to encourage his companions or to express satisfaction at his throw. Beside the 

couch is a small table on which stand three cakes (-nvpauiSes) and some small round 

objects, perhaps nuts or another variety of cake, destined for the winners at the 

game.

Rolf Hurschmann in his recent book Symposienszenen auf unteritalischen Vasen

places the Vatican krater in his category of Dionysiac symposia (pp. 144�9), as 

against the everyday type (pp. 61-2). There can be no doubt of the strong Dionysiac 

element in the scene on our vase, strengthened by the presence of the papposilen and 

the young satyr-boy, as well as by the three masks, but whether these are intended as 

symbols of the incorporation of the three banqueters into the Dionysiac thiasos, 

seems to me open to question. Dionysos was god of drama, and a symposium, 

especially with such a theatrical connection as we have here, seems a very likely way 

in which to render homage to the god, as successful actors might well wish to do; 

symposia are obviously a favourite theme with Python, since he depicted them on no 

fewer than seven vases, of which three are of recent discovery and were not known to 

Hurschmann, who lists only four on pp. 197-8.

The Dionysiac scene on the reverse is more carefully drawn than are most of its 

kind. In the centre sits Dionysos between a maenad and a silen, while above appear 

the busts of a similar-looking pair. There is a strong general resemblance between 

the figures here and those on the Orestes krater, especially between the silens on the 

right of the two designs, but the drawing on our vase is better, and the extremely 

good state of preservation gives the figures a sharpness which on the Orestes krater 

they do not possess. 

The obverse, too, has marked affinities with the style of Python, especially in the 

rendering of the faces. Remove the pilos of Antenor, and the resemblance between 

him and the two diners on the left is most pronounced. There is the characteristic 

mat-like hair, the fondness for elaborate drapery, the extensive use of white dots and 

of shades of yellow and orange which we have noted on others of his vases, and there 

can be little doubt that here we have one of his own works. This is important 

because, like the Orestes krater, this vase illustrates a number of the stock characters 

of his repertory. The phlyax masks will serve as the models for the features of a 

number of phlyakes, and the maenad on the reverse and the diners on the obverse 

will all appear again on later vases. One small point in Python's drawing of a phlyax 

mask is the pronounced ridge at the bottom of the forehead, just above the dip of the

nose, which is emphasised much more strongly on his phlyakes (cf. nos. 258, 269, 

278) than on those of Asteas. 

Despite obvious weaknesses this is a satisfactory vase�the composition is good, 

and the spacing of the figures far better than on the Orestes krater. Particularly good 

is the drawing of the face of the sleeping silen, and the use of colour is most effective. 

Of the six other vases by Python which depict symposia, three should find a 

place is this context and the other three, with rather simpler scenes, are dealt with in 

section 4. First we may consider two large bell-kraters, which have survived only in 

fragmentary form, but, from what remains, seem very close in treatment to the 

Vatican krater. 

Bell-krater fragments

(a) Standing draped woman, wearing black chiton and playing the flute, two banqueters 
on a couch with a kottabos-stand between them; below, to 1. table with oenochoe on it, to r. 
legs of sleeping papposilen, [b) completely missing. 

*247 B.M., from the wreck of the Colossus. 23 x 29 cm. PLATE 93 c 
(a) Three banqueters on a couch, with a papposilen seated below and a small figure to 1., 
now largely gone, [b) nude youth between two draped women. 

On no. 246 we have on the left the flute-player, now wearing a black chiton 

with a red band down the sleeves and a piece of drapery, with a chequer border, 

across the lower part of her body. She holds the flute in both hands and is clearly 

playing it, to judge from her mouth and cheek. On the couch, which is like the one 

on the Vatican krater, sits a half-draped youth with an egg in his left hand, resting 

against a red cushion; behind him is another youth, with a small cup held by one 

finger of his right hand, as for kottabos, but the left half of the upper part of his body 

is missing. Between the two was a kottabos-stand and in front of the couch is a table 

on which stand a metal oenochoe and some white objects. Beside it are the legs and 

right arm of a papposilen, obviously a counterpart of the one on no. 245. The scene, 

which was framed between reserved bands, was obviously very similar to the one on 

the Vatican krater, from which it shows only minor variations. The reverse is 

completely lost. 

The second krater comes from the wreck of the Colossus and was formerly in the 

collection of Sir William Hamilton. At first one wondered whether part of the 

missing krater drawn by Tischbein (II, 52) might not here have been located, but 

the addition of further fragments showed that this was not the case and that it was a 

vase previously unknown. The very fragmentary reverse showed a nude youth 

between two draped women, not unlike that of the Louvre Cadmus krater in some 

respects, and this would indicate that it was not a 'standard' piece. What remains of 

the obverse shows parts of two banqueters on a couch of the usual type, with the 

head and shoulders of a papposilen in front of it. The banqueters are draped exactly 

as on the other two vases, the lower part of their bodies being covered by a piece of 

drapery with a chequer border. 

With these we should consider a kylix from the same tomb as the signed neck-

amphora.

I. Symposium�to 1. standing draped woman (with incised inscription EMAYTA), two 
banqueters on a couch. 
Exergue: reclining nude youth. 
Ext.: laurel-wreath, in added white, with central flower. 

On the scene in the tondo we have only two banqueters, one of whom holds a 

thyrsus in his left hand, while he rests his right upon the shoulder of the other, who 

turns his head towards him. The thyrsus suggests that it is Dionysos himself who is 

present at this symposium. The couch is slightly less elaborate than those on the 

three preceding vases; each of the banqueters has a cushion, one striped, one in red, 

patterned with white dots. There is the usual hanging red drape in front, and beside 

it is a table with a row of eggs on top and a white-dotted red fillet looped over it. A 

long-necked white bird (goose ?) eyes it with interest. To left stands a draped 

woman, drawn on a smaller scale than the other two figures, and not well preserved. 

Like the women on nos. 245-6 she is also playing the flute, although the hands that 

held the two reeds (all in added white) have now largely vanished. Above her is the 

incised inscription EMAYTA, which has been interpreted as eiu' but in the light 

of the inscription on the Campanian hydria Naples 146735 from Castelcapuano 

(Pesce, NSc 1935, pp. 265-6, pi. 17,1; LCS, p. 261, no. 235; Napoli antica, pp. 249-50, 

no. 56,3 with ill.), which runs EMAYTO FOINIONOZ KAAAENIKAI EIMI TQ, it 

may well be a proper name, with possible reference to the owner or the dedicator of 

the vase. 

In the exergue, a youth lies prone on the ground, a wisp of coloured drapery 

across his back. The scene in the tondo is encircled by a narrow reserved band, with 

an ivy-pattern border outside it. 

That the kylix is by Python there can be little doubt, as the two banqueters are 

very like those on the other vases, and such an attribution is rendered more likely by 

the fact that it was found together with the signed amphora. 

Finally, among Python's more elaborate vases we should consider two hydriai, 

both with subjects associated with mythology and drama.

In PP (p. 58) doubts were cast upon the existence of the inscription ATPIOZ on 

the B.M. hydria (no. 249), but an infra-red photograph has resolved them and 

shown that it is indeed there. We may therefore return to the earlier interpretation of 

the scene represented upon it, which may have drawn its inspiration from the Oineus 

'"Both Margot Schmidt in Eine Gruppe Apulischer Grabvasen, pp. 121-2 and Hurschmann (p. 149) 

speak of her right hand as being raised in a gesture of adoration; this is not so, as her hands are in fact 

grasping the two reeds of the flute she holds up to her lips. They are clearly visible on the actual vase, 

although the added white has now disappeared. 

of Euripides, of which we know little. The extant versions of the Agrios story do not 

fit in very well with the scene here depicted. The aged Oineus was dispossessed of his 

kingdom by the sons of Agrios, who handed it over to their father; Oineus suffered 

maltreatment and indignity at their hands, but was later rescued by his grandson 

Diomedes, on his return from Troy, who slew most of the sons of Agrios and restored 

Oineus to his throne. In that case the scene here must be interpreted as showing 

Agrios, as a prisoner, since his hands are bound, seated upon an altar, beside which 

emerges a black Fury, and the aged Oineus, with his younger second wife Periboia 

and his grandson Diomedes. The scene, therefore, might be taken as illustrating the 

denouement of the play, when Periboia brings along the aged Oineus, who has now 

resumed his royal rank, as his costume and sceptre indicate, and to whom Diomedes 

holds out the sword with which he may take vengeance upon Agrios, an act 

symbolised by the presence of the black Fury. The use of black in this context is 

interesting since Aeschylus speaks of the Furies as sable-garbed (Choeph. 1049; Eum. 

370). 

Stylistically the vase follows very closely on the Alkmene krater; the drapery is 

less elaborate, but the parallel between Oineus and Agrios and the principal figures 

on the obverse of the Alkmene vase is very clear. The king has the same long face, 

large nose, deep-set eyes and narrow shoulders of Zeus or Amphitryon, and the 

youth and woman both have the long nose and rounded chin which were a feature of 

Python's people. There are also points of resemblance in the treatment of the 

drapery, and there is the same meander and chequered square pattern below the 

picture, a decorative motive favoured more by Python than by Asteas. 

Beneath the handles are the usual female heads, though with the one to right 

the upper part of the body is also shown, draped in a dot-stripe bordered himation. 

Both have one raised hand visible; the hair is caught up in a saccos on the left and a 

beaded sphendone on the right. 

The other hydria (no. 250) shows the familiar scene of the meeting of Orestes, 

Pylades and Electra at the tomb of Agamemnon. It comes from Tomb 7 in the 1954 

excavations in the Contrada Andriuolo-Laghetto and was found together with three 

minor vases (inv. 5429, 5433, 5434) from the Asteas-Python workshop, two r.f. vases 

by the Laghetto Painter (LCS, pp. 298-9, nos. 510 and 512, pis. 119, 5-6 and 120,6), 

with two in applied red by the same hand, and five others in the same technique (see 

Appendix I). The scene on the vase offers nothing new�Electra is seated on an altar 

in front of the Ionic column marking the tomb; she clasps a hydria in her left hand 

and wears a black chiton. On either side stand Orestes and Pylades, each wearing a 

pilos and carrying a spear, Pylades a sword as well. The rendering of the hair and the 

drapery, the drawing of the faces and of the female heads below the side-handles are 

all in Python's manner, and this is probably one of his less pretentious mythological 

vases. 

(i) Bell-kraters 

The two preceding sections dealt with the two vases signed by Python and with a 

small group of others, decorated in an elaborate manner with mythological or 

Hyginus, Fab. 175; Apollodorus, 1.8.6. See also Sechan, Etudes, pp. 442-6; Webster, Tragedies of 

Euripides, p. 113. 

Dionysiac subjects, which could be ascribed to his hand because of their close 

connection with the two which bear his signature. This section deals with what may 

be termed Python's standard vases, among which bell-kraters (division i) and neck-

amphorae (division ii) predominate. These are normally decorated with a two-

figure composition on the obverse and two draped youths on the reverse, though, 

especially on those of smaller dimensions, the decoration may be reduced to a single 

figure on one or both sides. Python also decorated vases of other shapes (division iii), 

but it seems clear that he had a marked preference for the bell-krater, which he 

normally decorates with Dionysiac themes of various kinds. It is remarkable how 

seldom female figures appear on bell-kraters, and then usually as maenads, either 

with Dionysos or a silen. Only once (on no. 280) does a woman appear in local 

costume along with a warrior, although this is a theme especially popular with the 

Campanian vase-painters at this time, and is used frequently in the painted 

decoration of Paestan tombs. The extreme uniformity of shape and decoration on 

the bell-kraters produces an effect of monotony, which is occasionally relieved by the 

presence of a suspended mask or a face in the window, or by an unusual treatment of 

a stock theme. Python rarely moves into the world of mythology on his less 

pretentious vases�Odysseus and the Sirens on Berlin 4532 (no. 272) is perhaps the 

best example, and this vase might well have been placed in the preceding section, 

were it not for the draped youths on its reverse, which associate it more closely with 

the standard vases. A few of the neck-amphorae also have mythological subjects, 

including Poseidon with Amymone or Amphitrite, and on them women make a 

more frequent appearance. 

Over 100 bell-kraters of varying sizes can be assigned to Python and his close 

associates. They fall into three main groups: (a) normally with two-figure compo 

sitions on either side, (b) with two figures on the obverse, but only one on the reverse, 

(c) with a single figure on either side. A fourth group (d) lists a few small kraters 

which seem to be the work of a close follower rather than by the painter himself, as 

may also be the case with nos. 251, 261-3 and 305. 

(a) Normally with two-figure compositions 

Without exception the vases in this sub-division have two draped youths on their 

reverses, and we may reasonably assume that this is also true for those which are now 

lost (nos. 295-9). A study of the draped youths reveals a steady development in their 

treatment. At first they are still close to those on the earlier vases in section 1, and 

less emphasis is placed on the dot-stripe borders. Type Al regularly appears on the 

left, sometimes with a slight pot-belly (e.g. nos. 252-3, 255-6) and the right leg 

visible beneath the drapery. The youths on four vases (nos. 251, 261-3) stand a little 

apart from the others and it is possible (see below) that these vases are the work of a 

close follower rather than by Python himself. The youth to right is usually of Type 

A2 or A3. The half-draped youth (Type B) soon puts in an appearance; on no. 265 

both are so shown, but this is exceptional. Nos. 267-9 show an experimental draping 

in which the himation of one of the youths is drawn up to cover the back of his head; 

it does not seem to have been very successful, as it is found only on these three vases, 

of which nos. 267-8 could again be the work of a close imitator, though no. 269 is 

surely by Python himself. With Sydney 48.04 (no. 270) we are approaching the more

AfTAPXAl, pp. 475 ff, with illustrations on pis. 128-31. 

mature phase of Python's work, which is characterised by a much more positive 

treatment of the dot-stripe borders. On some of the vases the youth to left is half-

draped (e.g. nos. 270-2), but Python soon settles for a V-drape (Type A3), which 

appears on almost all the remaining kraters (nos. 273 ff); the left hand often projects 

slightly outwards from the body and grasps a stick, of which the upper part remains 

hidden beneath the covering drapery. The youth to right is normally of Type A2r 

and usually there is some object held in the right hand�a spray, a fillet, a 'skewer of 

fruit' or an egg. The canonical representation of the two draped youths at this period 
Fig. 5. Dot-stripe borders on Liverpool M 10711 (no. 281) 

is well exemplified on Liverpool M 10711 (no. 281); it is repeated, with minor 

variations on the location of the dot-stripe borders, on nos. 270-272, and may be 

taken as the characteristic Python reverse (Fig. 5). It may also be worth noting that 

in his later phase Python often places a scroll or a drop-leaf beside the framing 

palmettes (e.g. nos. 273-7, 279-292; cf. also no. 263). 

As has already been pointed out, there is comparatively little variety in the 

choice of subjects for the obverses; of the 50 vases listed in this division, 36 depict 

Dionysos in the company of a papposilen, bearded silen, boy, young satyr, maenad 

or woman (23), of a phlyax (8), Pan (4), a centaur (1); of the remaining 14, four 

represent a bearded silen (three with a maenad and one with a centaur), three 

banqueters, two phlyakes, two papposilens (one with Apollo and one with a sphinx), 

one Aphrodite and Eros, one Odysseus and the sirens, and one a woman in native 

costume with a warrior. With the exception of Berlin 4532 (no. 272) all have the 

standard framing palmettes and all have wave-pattern below the pictures. White 

ivy, either as individual leaves, or as a wreath or trail is the most frequent adjunct; 

wreaths, tambourines and fillets are also used, and they may be enlivened with 

touches of red. A small stele is often placed in one of the lower corners of the obverse 

design, and occasionally on the reverse as well. 

Small birds or animals occasionally appear at ground level�e.g. geese or ducks 

on nos. 251 and 254, a feline on no. 252, a hare on no. 283, a coiled snake on no. 288. 

Seated figures (less frequent than one might expect, since there are only 11) mostly 

sit upon tendrils in added white; the enclosed palmette-fans, sometimes used by 

Asteas for this purpose, do not appear. 

Comic masks appear upon six of the vases�one is a phlyax Type B (no. 269), 

the other five are all female, generally with white flesh and in three instances 

suspended above the scene (nos. 254 and 268 = Type XA; no. 279 = Type S; no. 

284 = Type XC, and no. 296 = Type XB). Women look down from the windows

on nos. 252, 270, 278-9 and 289; and busts appear above the figures on nos. 257, 

275, 275a and 283, on the first and the last two of a maenad, on the second of a 

goddess, since she wears a polos with veil and holds a sceptre. 

The kraters on which Dionysos is depicted call for little special comment. The 

god himself changes comparatively little in appearance whether he is standing, 

seated or running; he usually wears an ivy-wreath or a dotted fillet round his head, 

and has a small piece of dot-striped drapery disposed somewhere about his person; 

he normally holds a thyrsus in one hand and some other object (phiale, kantharos, 

fillet, wreath) in the other. His companions are also, for the most part, stock types, 

especially the papposilen and the bearded silen who reappear in much the same 

guise. The only unusual vase with Dionysos is the bell-krater from Montesarchio 

Tomb 586 (Benevento 28223; no. 252), on which he appears riding somewhat 

precariously upon a flute-playing centaur, who has a little white bell suspended from 

his left wrist, while a woman watches with an air of slight surprise from a window up 

above. 

Of the vases on which Dionysos himself does not appear, six (nos. 256, 257, 275, 

286, 291 and 294) have a close connection with him in that each represents a silen or 

papposilen. No. 257, somewhat exceptionally, shows a silen in active pursuit of a 

maenad, who seems completely disinterested, but whose filmy garment, very like 

that of the maenad to right on the reverse of the Alkmene krater (no. 239), which 

reveals her body beneath it, has perhaps aroused the silen, though he is not here 

ithyphallic as on no. 256; this is a rare phenomenon in Paestan. From above, the bust 

of a maenad, holding a thyrsus, looks down (cf. no. 283). On no. 291 the silen 

appears with a centaur, who is probably meant to represent Chiron, about to deposit 

the branch, hung with votive offerings, which he is carrying in his left hand, to 

Apollo as a token of gratitude for his cure. A somewhat similar scene, in which the 

silen is replaced by a phlyax, appears on the lost bell-krater, formerly in the 

possession of Sig. Pacileo in Naples (no. 295), and here the presence of the phlyax 

points to some connection with the stage. Nos. 275 and 288 have subjects of slightly 

greater interest. On the former a papposilen, holding plectrum and cithara, stands 

beside Apollo, who is draped in typical Dionysiac fashion but is readily identified by 

'On this topic see K. Schauenburg, 'Frauen im Fenster', in RM 79, 1972, pp. 1-15, where nos. 

270-279 are discussed on pp. 6-7 and illustrated on pi. 18; see also Richter, Perspective in Greek and Roman 

Art, p. 44. 

the laurel branch he holds in his right hand and the laurel-wreath about his head; 

the scene may have some connection with the contest between Apollo and Marsyas, 

but the identity of the goddess whose bust appears above is not easy to determine. 

The Naples krater (no. 288) which seems to have drawn its inspiration from some 

comic version of the legend of Oedipus and the Sphinx, perhaps connected with the 

I<piy� actTupiKT) of Aeschylus, the satyr play which completed his Theban trilogy. A 

papposilen holds up a bird in front of the Sphinx, who sits upon a pile of ornamental 

rocks. It reminds us of the fable of Aesop (Fab. 55) in which an evil man, wishing to 

confound Apollo, visited his oracle with a live bird concealed beneath his cloak, and 

asked the god to declare whether the bird he held was alive or dead, intending to kill 

the bird if Apollo gave the former answer, or to leave it alive if the latter. Apollo was 

too wise to fall into the trap, but probably the Sphinx gave the wrong answer, in 

order to provide a suitable comic ending for the satyr play. The Dundee and 

Mannheim kraters (nos. 263 and 292) both show a papposilen holding up a bird in 

front of Dionysos, and the Liverpool krater (no. 281) shows him doing the same 

thing in front of a phlyax. These three may perhaps be connected with the story in 

Aesop and thus indirectly with the scene on the Naples krater. The body of the 

Sphinx is a shaded buff colour like that used for Opheltes on the Bari fragment (no. 

242 above). 

The only extant vase by Python with a comic scene taking place on a stage is 

B.M. F 189 (no. 280); here the stage is supported on Doric columns with garlands of 

ivy and red fillets between them, and tall posts on either side which serves as a frame 

for the picture. An older man with pointed white beard (Type L) holds up a 

walking-stick in his left hand and with his right firmly grasps the arm of a young man 

(Type B), who bends slightly backwards. He holds a situla (see Chapter IV, note 6) 

in one hand and a dish of eggs in the other. The scene used to be interpreted as a 

father dragging his reluctant son home after the banquet, but the younger man is 

more likely to be the old man's servant, who has attended him to the feast, and has 

become drunk, as in various extant fragments of Greek Middle Comedy (e.g. 

Eubulus 126; Alexis 25). 

Louvre K 264 (no. 251) shows a seated half-draped figure of Aphrodite with full 

breasts (as with Alkmene) together with an Eros, on a somewhat smaller scale, who 

holds a thymiaterion in his right hand. The scene may have some connection with a 

possible cult of Eros in Magna Graecia, but its main interest here is that it is one of 

the comparatively few Paestan vases on which Aphrodite is the principal figure�she 

normally plays more of a supporting role (as in the Judgment of Paris) or else 

appears only as a bust above (as on no. 134). 

Three vases (nos. 286-7 and 299) show a symposium, in which the scenes on 

nos. 245-7 are reproduced in a somewhat simplified form. The first two are very 

similar in treatment, with only slight variations between the poses of the banqueters; 

on both there is a table in front of the couch, and beside it a papposilen, facing to 

right and playing the flute on no. 287, facing to left, with a small stele behind him on 

no. 286. Their two reverses are almost identical, canonical Python of his later phase. 

For a fuller study of the Naples krater and related vases, see J-M. Moret, Oedipe, la Sphinx et les 

Thebains (1984), pp. 139-142, where nos. 288, 263 and 292 are published on pis. 92-3. On the 

representations of the satyr-play by Aeschylus see Moret, loc. cit. and pi. 90; Erika Simon, Das Satyrspiel 

Sphinx des Aischylos (SB Heidelberg, 1981), 'Satyr-Plays on vases in the Time of Aeschylus' in The Eye of 

Greece (1982), pp. 123^-8, and The Ancient Theatre (1982), pp. 15 ff 

The lost vase published by Tischbein (11.52) omits the papposilen, but adds a nude 

girl playing the flute as she stands on the edge of the couch; the banqueter beside her 

touches her body with his right hand, and his legs drop down over the couch, as on 

no. 287. The three make a closely-connected group. 

Of all the vases in this division the Odysseus krater is perhaps the most exciting. 

It came from the same tomb as a Campanian hydria, from the workshop of the 

Cassandra Painter, representing the Birth of Helen (Berlin inv. 4533 = LCS, p. 228, 

no. 9, pi. 89, 4�6), and this fact raises the interesting possibility that Python might 

have seen that vase and drawn from its subject the inspiration for his signed neck-

amphora, though his treatment differs considerably in detail. The Berlin krater is 

remarkable both for the rarity of its subject-matter and the novel manner in which 

it has been depicted; it has been the subject of a detailed study by Hauser (FR iii, 

pp. 57 ff, pi. 130), whose attribution of the vase to Python has met with general 

acceptance. 

Odysseus, wearing a red chiton and a pilos, is standing bound to the mast of the 

ship, which is passing beside the rocks on which are seated the Sirens, one of whom 

holds a lyre and the other a tambourine. The attitudes of the crew vary; their ears 

have been stopped with wax, so most of them carry on as if nothing untoward was 

happening, and look at the Sirens in frank amazement. The helmsman, however, has 

played for safety, and wrapped himself up completely in his red cloak, letting the 

steering-oar follow its own devices. The boat itself is a small affair; the prow is in the 

form of a swan's head, and the bow, which resembles the snout of a pig, has a large 

apotropaic eye painted upon it, with long, curling lashes. The sea is represented by 

waves which might easily be mistaken for grass; to make quite sure nobody will be 

deceived, Python has added three small fish in white as well. Even as it is, the 

possition of the oars looks curious, but originally the first one had been drawn 

sloping to the left. 

In view of its multi-figured composition this vase ought perhaps to have been 

placed with Python's more elaborate vases, but the fact that its reverse is decorated 

with two draped youths suggests that he himself did not so regard it. The 

miniaturisation of the figures has contributed greatly to the success of the vase, which 

Beazley calls 'a commendable sea-piece'. The figures on the obverse are mostly 

smaller scale versions of others on the larger vases (e.g. Amphitryon, the Clouds), 

and the extensive use of added red, with a good deal of white, enlivens the vase 

without dominating it. The swan's head prow of the boat reminds us of the head of 

the swan on the Ganymede fragment (no. 243). The youths on the reverse are 

typical of Python's later phase, and it is rather surprising to see that for the side 

palmette-scrolls he has reverted to those of an earlier date (cf. nos. 31-3 above). 

Lastly, we must look at the Richmond krater (no. 285) with its unusual obverse 

showing a woman, wearing a native cap, offering a libation to a warrior, with a 

crested, two-plumed helmet on his head, and carrying two spears and a shield with a 

lion blazon in his left hand, a spray in his right. Representations of women in any 

The representations of Odysseus and the sirens are given by Odette Touchefeu-Meynier in her 

book Themes odysseens dans I'art antique (1968), pp. 144 ff., pis. 23-4, where eight vases are listed of which 

ours is the only South Italian example. See also Brommer, Odysseus (1983), pp. 83-8 and VI?, 

pp. 441-2. 

form of native costume are extremely rare in Paestan, rather surprisingly in view of 

their not infrequent appearance on the tomb paintings and on the vases of the other 

fabrics, especially Campanian and Apulian. Here she wears a bag-like headdress,

resembling a coif, which is very like those on Vienna 1084 and 4033 (LCS, p. 562, 

nos. 930-1, pis. 222, 2-3), and which seems otherwise to be confined to Campanian. 

The rest of her costume calls for no special comment, since it is an ordinary peplos, 

with overfall, decorated with a double dot-stripe running down the centre. A native 

element in the armour of the warrior may be noted in the two feathers standing up 

on either side of his helmet; these are typical of the Samnites.

The Richmond krater is also of considerable stylistic interest, since it is very 

close to the work of the Boston Orestes Painter, who must have been a pupil of 

Python, towards the latter part of his career; this is very clear from a comparison 

between it and such vases as B.M. F 154 or Benevento 28497, or between its reverse 

and those of Sydney 48.06, Vienna 622 and 964, where the influence of Python is 

particularly strong. The drawing of the faces of all the figures on no. 285 differs to 

some extent from his normal manner; they have a more rectangular look, of which 

we have already noted a fore-runner on the reverse of Louvre K247 (no. 231). A 

similar phenomenon may be observed on others of the later vases (e.g. nos. 283^t) 

and to a lesser extent on nos. 275, 280, 287 and 292. It would be difficult to separate 

the reverse of no. 285 from those of nos. 280 and 284, and the vase looks to be a late 

work by Python, at the time when his style was beginning to harden. 

We may also contrast the faces of Dionysos on the Dundee and Mannheim 

kraters (nos. 263 and 292), which both have the same subject on the obverse; this is 

brought out very clearly on pi. 93 of Moret's Oedipe, where details of the two obverses 

are published side by side. The latter seems to me definitely to be by Python, but the 

former might be the work of a close imitator, to whose hand we should also ascribe 

nos. 251, 261 and 262, from the similarity of their reverses to that of no. 263, and also 

probably no. 305, on which the seated Dionysos should be compared with the one on 

the obverse of that vase. The members of the Asteas-Python workshop clearly 

worked in very close collaboration and, when they use the same designs and pattern-

work, their vases cannot be anything but remarkably alike.

"The article 'Sprang Hair-nets' by Ian Jenkins and Dyfri Williams in AJA 89, 1985, pp. 411-6 has 

many useful observations on head-dresses; the one on the Richmond vase should be compared with the

(b) With two figures on the obverse but only one on the reverse 

The obverses of the vases in this sub-division are very close to those in the preceding 

one and nearly all the figures on them find counterparts there, or on other vases by 

Python. The bearded silen on nos. 300-302 is comparable to those on the reverses of 

the B.M. Orestes and Vatican symposium kraters (nos. 244-5) and also on nos. 270 

and 291; the Dionysos on no. 301 resembles his counterpart on nos. 278-9 and 281, 

and the young satyr on the same vase the one on no. 264. The obverse of no. 303 is 

like those of nos. 269 and 290; the Dionysos is also comparable to the one on no. 282, 

the papposilen to that on no. 288. No. 305 stands a little apart from the others, 

nearer perhaps to no. 263 and probably by an imitator rather than by Python 

himself. Not much can be said at this juncture about no. 304, which I have not been 

able to study in detail, but the subject is of unusual interest and seems to represent 

Dionysos watching the anodos of a goddess, presumably Aphrodite, who rises up 

from the ground beneath a laurel tree, painted in applied colour. 

The subject of no. 300�Hermes sacrificing a goat�is also of interest. The 

presence of the bust of a silen in the background suggests that the sacrifice is to 

Dionysos, and in that case a goat would be the appropriate victim. In his left hand, 

Hermes holds a dish of sacrificial cakes, among which is a irupauis. He wears high 

boots with wings attached; his petasos (as on the Cadmus krater) is white and hangs 

behind his head, and he carries a caduceus from which hangs a small bead-chain 

with a tassle at the end. The wreath in his hair is like that of Apollo On the Orestes 

krater, and he is in every way a typical creation of Python. On the reverse is a 

"Not a ram, as Watzinger (RF iii, p. 372, note 2) calls it. A similar scene occurs on a Hadrianic 

bronze coin (Bernhart, Miinzkunde der rbm. Kaiserzeit, pi. 47,3). Vergil tells us [Georg. 2, 380�B

caper omnibus aris caeditur) that a goat is the right sacrifice to Dionysos; an Apulian calyx-krater in 

Madrid (32651, ex Prado 116 = RVAp I, p. 148, no. 6/98) shows a satyr bringing up a goat as a sacrifice 

to Dionysos.

(c) With a single figure on each side 

The smaller bell-kraters listed below have mostly a single figure on each side,

adapted from one of the larger compositions. There are numerous stock types which 

repeat with comparatively little variation from vase to vase. Among these we may 

note, in particular, the following, as appearing most frequently: 

Dionysos�nude: standing or striding, generally with a piece of drapery with a dot-

stripe border across the lower part of his body�320-1, 334, 337-8, 340; 330-1, 

333, 335. 

seated, half-draped: 324-7, 336, 338-9, 341. 

Bearded silen: 307, 309-12, 332, 336. 

Young satyr�bending forward: 326-7, 329-30, 332-5; moving to right or left: 

316-9, 324-5. 

Woman or maenad�draped, standing: 308, 313, 321-2, 337; with black, or 

red drapery: 309, 315; by laver: 310-11. 

, seated, half-draped: 319, 320, 333, 342a. 

We may also note the appearance of a duck on 306, 308 and 341, a laver on 310-11

a dotted rock on 307, 321, 332 and a bird-trap on 341-2. 

Very few of these vases have any special interest of subject. The phlyax on no. 

306 is well drawn�he is obviously running back after a banquet, since he carries a 

torch in one hand while the other supports a basket of cakes on his head; to right is 

an 'early bird', a small duck with a worm in its mouth. He wears the typical costume 

of white tunic over red jerkin on top of tights, the legs and arms of which bear the 

usual white stripe. No. 307 has one of the few mythological themes in this division 

and shows Actaeon being torn to pieces by his maddened hounds; the bearded silen 

on its reverse is one of the most favoured of Python's characters. No. 308 represents 

Hermes, with petasos and caduceus, and rather unexpectedly a spear and sheathed 

sword as well; on the other side is a maenad wearing a peplos with overfall and a 

central dot-stripe in the usual manner. Sometimes the women wear a red (309) or 

black chiton (315), but normally on these vases there is little added colour beyond 

white and yellow. The satyr on Louvre K 250 (no. 318) carrying over his shoulder a 

wine-skin with a white-dotted red fillet tied round it is almost identical with the one 

on the Louvre cup K 363 (no. 376). A bell-krater in a Naples private collection (no. 

329) shows a youthful Herakles seated upon a red pelt, lion-skin down his back and 

club in his left hand, and holding up a dish of cakes in his right hand, while in front 

of him is a well-filled cornucopia. Above is the bust of a maenad, wearing a fawn-

skin knotted at her throat. It recalls the scene on a Campanian bell-krater by the 

Plouton Painter, now in Eton College, on which Herakles is helping himself to 

goodies from a cornucopia held by Pluto. Lastly we may glance at two vases (nos. 

341-2) showing Eros holding a bird-trap; the same object will be seen on the neck-

amphora Louvre K 301 (no. 355 below), which has now been transferred to Python. 

Evidence of its use may be seen on the lid (unpublished) of a Campanian lekanis in a 

private collection in Naples which shows on one side Eros holding a trap and on the 

other Eros extracting a trapped bird from it; a Gnathia lekythos in the Louvre 

(K 615) shows Eros holding a similar trap open to catch a bird that is flying towards 

it, and Heydemann (Pariser Antiken, p. 84) gives a drawing of another vase of the 

same fabric showing a bird with its legs caught in the trap. This was evidently set by 

means of a vertical bar, which is sometimes shown with a length of string attached to 

it.

(d) Closely related 

The four bell-kraters in this sub-division go closely together; although the su

depicted upon them are similar to those on the vases in (c), the drawing is somewhat 

different and they seem to be the work of an imitator rather than by Python himself. 

The faces of the youths are flatter and have less expression and there is a slapdash air 

about them, especially on the Bucharest krater (no. 345). The obverse of Louvre 

K257 (no. 346) has been extensively repainted and the seated Dionysos has been 

provided with a beard, but the treatment of the youth on the reverse suggests it 

should find a place here. 

A few other small bell-kraters are listed in Chapter IX, which deals with the 

minor vases of the Asteas-Python workshop (nos. 427-437).

(ii) Neck amphorae 

After the bell-krater, the neck-amphora is the shape most frequently decorated by 

Python�it is perhaps significant that these are the only two shapes to bear his 

signature�and we now have some twenty examples, among which are a few with 

subjects of greater interest than usual on his standard vases, including the only two 

(nos. 349-50) to represent Poseidon, the titular deity of the city; one (no. 349) shows 

him with Amymone, identified by the hydria she holds in her left hand, the other 

with Amphitrite, who carries a sceptre to indicate that she is not an ordinary mortal. 

Two show Eros in the company of a woman, who may well be Aphrodite; on no. 347 

he reaches up to grasp a white-dotted red fillet she has just taken from an open box, 

on no. 355 he stands before her, his left hand, which holds a bird-trap (cf. nos. 

341-2), between her thighs. On no. 351 Hermes, with caduceus and leafy spray, 

standing facing a draped woman wearing a polos-crown and a veil; she might be 

Persephone, whom Hermes has come to summon back to earth. The two figures on 

the Kassel amphora (no. 348) might possibly be Orestes and Electra, but in the 

absence of the tomb of Agamemnon and of any distinguishing attributes it is 

probably safer not to give the scene any mythological significance. 

In shape, subject-matter, treatment and pattern-work, some of these amphorae 

stand very close to nos. 182-4 by Asteas, but their reverses seem to associate them 

more with Python. The mouth is fairly wide, with an overhanging lip, beneath 

which there is sometimes a reserved band. The neck, which is quite tall, is most 

commonly decorated with a female head, sometimes in a metope-like panel framed 

by reserved bands, beneath which will be bands of wave or tongues and sometimes 

both (e.g. on no. 347). Sometimes a siren replaces the female head on the obverse 

(e.g. nos. 347, 349, 355), and sometimes a palmette is found instead on the reverse 

(e.g. nos. 353, 357, 366); on the smaller vases there are palmettes on both sides. 

Occasionally the head or palmette is set comparatively low down on the neck, 

leaving a substantial area in black above it (e.g. nos. 353^, 357). The shoulder is 

usually decorated with a wreath of laurel, sometimes with a white and yellow flower 

in the centre, but only on the obverse (nos. 347, 349, 355); tongues are occasionally 

used instead, especially on the reverses (e.g. nos. 350-1, 353, 357), although they 

appear on both sides of the smaller vases. The foot, on the larger vases, is in two 

degrees and flares outwards with a comparatively wide base; the stem generally has 

a ridge in the centre. The amphorae vary in height from 28 to 55 cm.; the larger ones 

(40-55 cm.) will have two figures on both sides, the medium-sized and smaller ones 

(28^-5 cm.) will have either one or two figures on the obverse, with only one figure 

on the reverse. The pictures may be framed between reserved bands, but are often 

left free-standing between the palmette-fans below the handles. 

(a) With two figures on each side 

Most of the neck-amphorae in this division have two draped youths on their reverses 

and these correspond very closely with those on his bell-kraters. The draped female 

On Poseidon and Amymone see LIMC I, p. 742, where a full bibliography is given, together with 

a list of the representations of this subject on the following pages (not including no. 349); on Amphitrite 

see op. cit., pp. 424ff. (where no. 350 does not appear to be listed). 

figures on the obverses of nos. 347, 349 and 351 go closely together in the treatment 

of their drapery around and below the waist, which is very like that of the woman to 

left on the obverse of the Louvre Cadmus krater (no. 241). The sirens on the neck of 

nos. 347 and 349 are comparable to the one on the neck of Python's signed amphora 

(no. 240), and the standing draped woman on the reverse of no. 347 is very close to 

her counterpart on its reverse, where the treatment of the drapery around the waist 

is also very similar to that of the three women on nos. 347, 349 and 351 referred to 

above. No. 355 was previously associated with Asteas, but the draped woman on its 

reverse, the siren on the neck, and the bird-trap held by Eros all suggest it is better 

placed here, near to no. 352 in view of the close resemblance between the two draped 

figures to right on their reverses. The female heads on the necks mostly wear beaded 

sphendonai, although on no. 348 there is a radiate stephane in added white; their 

features tend to be rather heavy, with a flat brow-nose line and a strong chin. Part of 

the shoulder is occasionally visible, sometimes with a row of white beads down the 

sleeves as on nos. 347 and 355, and always with a black and/or white bead necklace.

(iii) Other Shapes 

This section contains a few vases of other shapes which, on stylistic grounds, look to 

be the work of Python or very closely associated with him. Of particular interest is 

the hydria from Pontecagnano now in the Salerno Museum (no. 367), which shows 

an Eros standing between a draped woman seated on a white tendril and a young 

Pan-satyr bending forward over his raised right foot which rests upon a similar 

tendril. The seated woman, for details of drapery, physical features and pose, should 

be compared with the women on nos. 256, 289, 353 and 357, also on the reverse of 

245 (for the beaded girdle); the Pan-satyr bending forward is a common type with 

Python, here the pose and drapery closely corresponds to that of Dionysos on the 

reverse of no. 306. The head below the handle on the left is very like that on the 

signed neck-amphora (no. 240), with a similar beaded bandeau; the other head is 

nearer to those on the necks of the amphorae in division (ii). There is also a 

connection with the work of the Painter of Wurzburg H 5739, who must have been a 

very close colleague of Python, to judge from the many elements their works have in 

common. 

The second hydria (no. 368) is unusual in that it depicts two nude women at a 

laver, a subject more commonly used for lebetes gamikoi, which perhaps explains 

why the scene is framed between reserved bands, not generally used on vases of this 

shape but common on the others. The vase suffered a very bad fissure in the firing, 

which completely split the body beside the right handle; the heads are in the typical 

Python manner. The black-draped woman on no. 370 finds a close parallel in the 

red-draped one on Bonn 3038 (no. 309); all three figures on no. 371 are familiar to us 

from other vases by Python, especially the papposilen to right. 

The kylix once in Ascona is perhaps by a close associate rather than the painter 

himself; indeed the Triton in the exergue recalls the similar figures by Asteas, but the 

standing draped woman is very much in Python's manner, like the papposilen. The 

four stemless cups are surely Python's own work, and very good examples of it, with 

his favourite bearded silens and young satyr with a wine-skin and pointed amphora, 

very like the one on the reverse of Louvre K368 (no. 318). All four have similar 

pattern-work in the exergue�an inverted palmette-fan between two rosettes, all in 

added white and all have a border round the tondo of ivy and berries in white with 

incised stems, and a similar pattern on the exterior.

There is no doubt that Asteas and Python dominated r.f. vase-painting at Paestu

during the third quarter of the fourth century B.C. and that the many stereotyped 

figures they produced for the decoration of their standard vases were sedulously 

imitated by what Beazley has called their 'well-drilled associates'. As a result, 

however, of the recently-discovered material, a few new personalities are beginning 

to emerge�painters who, while following the canons laid down by the two masters, 

had none the less certain clearly-defined stylistic characteristics of their own, which 

enable us to see them more as individuals than as workshop hacks, like the painters of 

nos. 261-3 and of nos. 343-6 in Chapter VII, or of many of the vases listed in 

Chapter IX. 

Most important of the new artists is the Painter of Wurzburg H 5739, with 

whom some forty vases can now be associated, of which only about a quarter were 

known when PPSupp and PAdd were published, where they were mostly assigned in 

general terms to the workshop. Other significant personalities have also begun to 

emerge, but as yet comparatively few vases can be specifically assigned to their 

various hands. 

The Aphrodite and Boston Orestes Painters, two highly important but slightly 

later members of the Asteas-Python workshop, whose vases mark the transition to 

the final stages of Paestan vase-painting, are dealt with separately in Chapter X. 

Those of the vases by the Painter of Wurzburg H 5739 that come from 

excavated tombs in the Paestum area have usually been found together with other 

vases from the Asteas-Python workshop�Tomb 27 from the 1967 excavations in the 

Contrada Andriuolo was remarkable in that it contained a set of five vases (inv. 

21386-90), all by this painter; Tombs 41 and 42 from the same site included various 

minor vases of the Asteas-Python workshop, and T. 41 contained the neck-amphora 

(21476) ascribed to Python (no. 352 above), to whom also was attributed the hydria 

from T. 30 in the Contrada Licinella in 1967 (inv. 20368 = no. 368 above) found 

together with a cup by the Painter of Wurzburg H5739 (inv. 20371) and some 

minor vases (inv. 20369-70). The cup from Contrada Gaudo (1972) Tomb 3 was 

found along with a lekanis lid of the Black and Red Group associated with Asteas 

(no. 169 above); and the two vases from Agropoli (inv. 20197, 20199), again in a 

context of works by Asteas and Python, including the former's signed hydria (no. 

134 above). These finds provide conclusive evidence for the close association of the 

Painter of Wurzburg H 5739 with Asteas and Python, and indeed their artistic 

influence is manifest everywhere in his work, especially in his compositions, 

rendering of drapery and the posing of the figures.

1. THE PAINTER OF WURZBURG H 5739 

The Painter of Wurzburg H5739 takes his name from a large neck-amphora, 

formerly in a German private collection and now in the Martin von Wagner 

Museum in Wurzburg. It is a vase of considerable interest for both subject-matter 

and style, since it well illustrates many of its painter's most noteworthy 

characteristics. 

(i) More elaborate vases 

Neck-amphora (with twisted handles) 

*379 Wurzburg H 5739. Ht. 73-5. PLATE 118 
K. Schauenburg in Kat.Hbg., no. 328, ill. on p. 379; Erika Simon, in Werke der Antike 
(1983), p. 148, no. 67, ill. on p. 149.; LIMC III p. 712, Elektra I 21, pi. 540, 2. 
(a) Makaria with the Herakleidai, two female busts above, [b) Al -I- A3c. 
Neck: [a) and [b) female head. 

The scene on the obverse shows a draped woman, with short hair, holding a 

bead-wreath and a mirror, seated upon an altar-like structure in front of an Ionic 

column, both in added white. She turns her head to left to look at a youth who wears 

a chlamys, with a petasos down his back, and holds a spear and a spray. There is a 

sheathed sword beneath his left arm; he stands upon ground indicated by rows of 

white dots. Balancing him to right is a second youth, also with spear and spray. 

Above, in typical Paestan fashion, are the busts of two women; they are set, as it 

were, in square panels, two sides of which are formed by the reserved framing band 

and the egg-pattern above the picture, the other two by wavy lines in added white 

(cf. Naples 1786, no. 385 below). 

The subject was originally thought by Schauenburg to represent the meeting 

between Orestes, Pylades and Electra at the tomb of Agamemnon, and the two busts 

above were taken to be those of two of the Furies (cf. with nos. 1, 144, 164, 244 

above, and with no. 1004, by the Boston Orestes Painter). As Erika Simon, however, 

pointed out, the figure seated on the altar was not holding a hydria (as Electra 

usually does in this context), and the two youths were both carrying 'suppliant 

boughs', which would be out of place for Orestes and Pylades; further, neither of the 

two busts had snakes in their hair or about their persons, and this would count 

against their identification as Furies. She thought the scene more probably depicted 

suppliants and suggested, as an alternative, that it represented the children of 

Herakles�Makaria seated upon the altar, with one of her brothers on either side. 

She thought the two busts might represent two of Makaria's sisters, but, as we have 

seen, such busts in Paestan often seem to have no specific identity, but rather merely 

to represent spectators. 

The reverse represents two youths, draped in himatia with dot-stripe borders; 

on the rather tall neck, on each side, set into a framed oblong panel, are the head and 

shoulders of a woman in profile to left. The pictures on both sides are framed by 

reserved bands, but it is to be noted that these do not reach to the bottom, but are 

cut off by the scrolls on either side of the superposed palmette-fans below the 

handles, a practice also adopted on Paestum 20199 (no. 380). 

The amphora well illustrates a number of what prove to be highly characteristic 

features of the painter's style and enable us to distinguish his work from that of 

Asteas and Python, which it so closely resembles in most respects. In his rendering of 

drapery we should note: 

(i) the curious way in which the dot-stripe border tends to break up down the 

side into a series of short parallel steps�this is very clear on the cloaks of the two 

youths on the obverse, and on the himatia of those on the reverse (see Fig. 6 a). A 

prototype for this may be seen on the reverse of the Louvre Cadmus krater by 

Python (no. 241), but it is not otherwise found on his extant vases. 

(ii) the dot-stripe border, both on the himatia of draped youths and on pieces of 

drapery covering the lower portions of seated figures, tends to assume a double curve 

(as on the reverse of this vase and of no. 385 and on the obverses of nos. 380, 382; see 
(a) [b) 

Fig. 6. Dot-stripe borders on Naples 1786 (no. 385), typical of the Painter of Wurzburg H 5739 

(iii) on the drapery of women, the area immediately around the breasts is often

left clear, with a series of fine vertical fold-lines running from beneath them to the 

girdle round the waist, as on Makaria. 

(iv) there is frequently a dot-stripe border round the top of the peplos at the 

neck, giving somewhat the effect of a collar, as on the two busts on the obverse, 

clearly modelled on the treatment of such busts by Asteas and Python. We may also 

note on this vase the black stripe running down the centre of the sleeve, with white 

beads on the two busts on the body of the vase but not on the neck, and the presence 

on the former of a dot-rosette pattern (cf. also the bust on the neck of no. 381). 

(v) peploi and himatia are often decorated with one or more rows of horizontal 

dots across them, as on the himatia of the two draped youths, or the piece of drapery 

over Makaria's legs. 

In the treatment of the figures we may note that: 

(vi) the heads are comparatively small, generally of neat appearance with a 

reserved line round the hair which, on male figures and especially Dionysos, is often 

long and falls down on to the shoulders in a series of curly locks. The headdresses 

vary�we may have a plain circlet (as on the reverse) or a bead-wreath (Makaria), a 

leafy wreath (the two Herakleidai), a stephane (bust to right) or, and this type is 

very characteristic, a diadem with short rays on either side of a central band. 

(vii) the painter is fond of representing the hair of women with a large bunch 

sticking up at the back and tied round by a white ribbon, sometimes with dot-

clusters at the ends; otherwise a sphendone or kekryphalos is used, generally decorated 

with black and white dots, with a bunch of solid black hair at the back. Makaria's 

hair is cut short, as a suppliant, but the touch of pink on her cheek is very much after 

the manner of Python. 

In shape the amphora is close to those already attributed to Asteas and Python; 

the neck is slightly taller than usual and the handles are ribbed, as on Python's 

signed amphora. 

Two other neck-amphorae are obviously the work of the same hand, and go 

very closely with no. 379:

Neck: (a) and [b) female bust in profile to 1. 

The youths on the reverse of no. 380 are very like those on no. 379, especially 

the treatment of the lower border of their himatia. On the piece of drapery over the 

left arm of the nude youth on the obverse we note the characteristically 'stepped' 

border; the treatment of the woman's breasts and the drapery around them 

corresponds with that on Makaria. Here we may note her pose, with one leg bent at 

the knee and crossed behind the other leg beneath the drapery, the vertical fold-lines 

on which are unaffected. The heads on the neck are also very similar, though 

somewhat less of the shoulders is visible. Both pictures are framed between vertical 

reserved bands; on no. 380 these stop short above the scrolls which curl out from the 

palmette-fans below the handles, exactly as on the preceding vase; the top left-hand 

corner of the obverse has a cross-bar which converts it into a triangle, as on so many 

of the Asteas-Python vases. 

The draped woman with one leg drawn back is repeated on no. 381, facing in 

the other direction. The treatment of her drapery is almost identical; on no. 381 she 

has long hair, which reaches down to the shoulders. The busts on the neck are like 

those on no. 379, and one has dotted rosettes on the upper portion of the chiton, as 

on the two busts at the top of the picture on that vase. No. 381 has a single figure on 

the reverse, a striding Dionysos with ivy-wreath (now partially lost) and shoulder-

length hair; we may note his rather prominent chin. 

Also close in style to these three vases is: 

Lebes gamikos

woman; between them, a white bird, [b) standing draped woman, with 'skewer of fruit' and

Lid: (i) (a) panther, [b) bird; (ii)�bowl: (a) nude youth, [b) seated half-draped woman 
with phiale; (iii)�knob: moulded into the shape of a bird. 
The shoulder on the obverse is decorated with white plastic heads, set in a shrine-like 
structure, and on the reverse with a three-tiered conical projection. 

The treatment of the drapery, especially of its dot-stripe borders and around t

women's breasts, the bunched hair, tied with ribbons, of the two women on the 

obverse, the standing figures with the leg drawn back, and other details all show the 

vase to belong here. The elaborate lid is very typical of the larger Paestan lebetes 

gamikoi and the knob on top, moulded in the form of a bird, finds a close parallel on 

no. 185.

Gaudo excavations of 1972, and this is confirmed by the illustration in Atti XIII� CStMG 1973, pi. 61,2. 

It was not to be found in Paestum during my visits there in 1983 and 1985, and must have made its way 

clandestinely to the Zurich market. Its present whereabouts is unknown to me. It does, however, 

indicate the connection between the Painter of Wurzburg H5739 and Asteas, to whose hand many of 

the other vases from the same tomb can be attributed.

Few of the above vases have any special interest of subject-matter, nearly all 

them being decorated with stock themes from the general repertory of the Asteas-

Python workshop. It is possible that the cup, no. 394, represents Hermes and Io, but 

it is not easy to be certain of the identity of the seated woman, who wears a black 

peplos with touches of red and white as on the vases in the Black and Red Group by 

Asteas and who has a small pair of horns on her brow. The presence of Hermes in 

this context suggests that she might be more than an ordinary mortal (cf. also no. 

408 below). The phiale, no. 399, is of interest for its shape, perhaps copied from that 

of Paestum 26636 by Asteas, since it has the same white star in the centre, but is less 

elaborately decorated; the bell-krater Naples 1786 (no. 385) takes us back to the 

painter's name vase, since it has a very similar bust, framed by white wavy lines, 

above the pictures. 

In composition, drawing, decorative patterns and adjuncts, as well as in the 

treatment of the drapery, all the vases are closely linked together. We see the 

painter's favourite step-pattern on the dot-stripes on nos. 383-7, 395 and 397, with 

rows of dots on the drapery on nos. 383, 385, 397; the youths on the reverses of nos. 

383, 385-6 all follow his conventional types; the hair of the women on nos. 384�5, 

387 is,done in just the same fashion as on nos. 379 or 382. We may note also the 

drawing of the exposed breasts of the half-draped women on nos. 384, 387, 389, 390, 

392, 396-7, with one rounded and the other pointed, the nipples shown as black 

dots. The woman wearing a peplos, with a long overfall, usually with a double dot-

stripe down the centre, appears on no. 384 and is repeated on nos. 386-8, 391 and 

395; sometimes one of her legs is bent outwards to the left (nos. 336-7, 391), at others 

to the right (nos. 384, 388). We may note the repetition of the dot-piles, on which 

figures sit or rest one foot, on nos. 389-90 and 392, as well as of such decorative 

adjuncts as sprays of ivy, white rosettes, tambourines, pendant strings of white beads. 

The rather curious filling ornament, in the form of a triangle decorated with a black 

T with a black and white dot to left and right of the vertical stroke (PI. 121 b) is 

repeated on nos. 400 and 402 below, which are also closely connected in style with 

the other vases listed above.

*400 Madrid 11139 (L. 430). Ht. 37. PLATE125a,A 
PP, no. 76, fig. 38; PPSupp, no. 108. 
Nude youth with drapery over both arms, holding fillet in r. hand and phiale and wreath 
in 1., seated half-draped woman with wreath in r. hand and mirror in 1.; to r., small stele. 
Below the handles: female heads. 
The heads are close to those on the necks of nos. 380-1 and also to those on the hydria no. 
408 below. 

Skyphoi 

*401 Madrid 11388 (L. 493). Ht. and diam. 17. PLATE 125c 
PP, no. 85; PPSupp, no. 114. 
(a) Nude woman, with fillet and mirror, standing to r., in front of a laver above which is 
a lion-spout; suspended above to r., piece of drapery, [b) seated half-draped woman with 
mirror and bead-wreath; part of altar to r. 

402 Paestum 20197, from Agropoli (Muoio, C. Vecchia, 1967). Ht. 20-6, diam. 17. In very bad 
condition; almost the whole of the reverse and a good deal of the upper part of the obverse is 
missing. 
Bottini and Greco, Dial, di Arch. 8/2, 1974-5, p. 245, no. 2, fig. 11. 
(a) Draped woman, wearing cloak over black chiton, standing to 1. by laver, [b) missing, 
except for the feet of two figures. 

The connection of nos. 400 and 401 is clear from the step-patterns on the 

drapery, as well as from the treatment of the half-draped seated woman on no. 400. 

That of no. 402 is less certain, since the vase is in very bad condition, only part of the 

obverse and none of the reverse remaining. The shape, decorative patterns, the 

framing of the pictures and the half-laver to left all link it with no. 401; the drapery 

of the woman, with the horizontal rows of dots, also suggests that it might well be 

placed here. 

Two other skyphoi seem also to be by this painter, though they show slight 

differences of treatment in the drawing and the drapery. 

*403 Paestum 21568, from C. Andriuolo (1969), T. 54. Ht. 20, diam. 30/19. PLATE 125 a" 
(a) Standing nude woman and draped woman with mirror, [b) standing half-draped 
woman. 
Double palmette, cf. with those on B.M. F357 (no. 409 below). 

404 Nohant, Chateau. Ht. 17.1. 
(a) Bearded silen with stick, bending forward by standing draped woman, holding fillet, 
[b) standing draped woman with 'skewer of fruit', nude youth with fillet. 

The first seems clearly to belong here, from the treatment of the naked woman 

on the obverse and the half-draped one on the reverse. The standing woman on the 

obverse is, at least to a certain extent, comparable to those on nos. 387 and 391, 

where we see a similar peplos with a long overfall and one leg bent, as well as much 

the same treatment of the drapery in the area of the breasts. On this skyphos, 

however, the dots accompanying the central stripe move from left to right as they 

descend, exactly as they do also on no. 404. The skyphos in the Chateau de Nohant 

was kindly brought to my notice by Dr. Dietrich von Bothmer and is known to me 

only from a photo-copy; such is the similarity between the standing woman on its 

obverse and that on no. 402 that they ought to be by the same painter. Here both 

pictures are framed between reserved bands as against framing palmettes on the 

reverse of no. 403, but otherwise the decoration is very similar. 

(iii) More developed in style 

We come now to a group of vases which, while still connected in style with those in 

(i) and (ii) above, differ somewhat from them in treatment and have certain marked 

characteristics of their own, notably in the heavier heads with their strongly 

pronounced chins which may be seen on many of the vases (e.g. nos. 408-12). They 

may well represent a more developed phase in the artist's career, since the heads 

below the handles on no. 409 find very close parallels in the heads on nos. 379 (bust, 

top left) and 382, and there are other points of resemblance (e.g.. in the half-draped 

women on nos. 405, 411 and 412; the dotted drapery on no. 406), but it will be noted 

that we no longer find the steps on the dot-stripe borders, and that the fold-lines 

across the drapery over the legs of seated figures assume a marked horizontal 

tendency (as on nos. 405, 411-12), which was not present before. We should also note 

the rendering of the faces with the very heavy chins, the slight downward curve to 

the mouth and the general look of severity, which is very apparent in the heads 

below the handles of the hydriai (nos. 406-9) as well as on the standing draped 

woman on no. 408 and the seated half-draped woman on nos. 410^11. 

The skyphos (no. 405) is similar in decoration to no. 402, with the same red 

fillets looped over the cross-bars of the triangles in the top left corners, and the half-

visible laver is also closely comparable, with the same black lines for the fluting on 

the pedestal; physically the seated Dionysos reminds us of the youth to left on the 

obverse of no. 379 and the head of the woman on the reverse recalls that of the 

woman on no. 395, but is still closer to the head below the left handle of no. 406. 

The heads below the handles of the four hydriai (nos. 406-9) have much in 

common between them�the downward curve of the mouth, the heavy, rounded 

chin, the drawing of the eyes, and, despite superficial differences, look to be the work 

of one painter (cf. also the heads on no. 410). The head of the seated woman on 

Warsaw 147160 (no. 411) is duplicated on the lekanis lid (no. 412), which is also 

extremely like those below the handles of no. 408. The superposed palmette-fans 

below the handles on the skyphos (no. 405) are comparable to those on no. 408, 

where the two component elements do not meet, as also on no. 409 where, however, 

the leaves of the lower fan turn inwards (cf. the skyphos no. 403). The hydriai seem 

to have drawn their inspiration from those by Asteas (cf. especially nos. 70-74 above, 

for the posing of the figures, the drapery and the palmettes below the handles); it will 

be noted that the standard framing palmettes appear behind the heads, except on 

no. 467, of which a good deal is missing.

wreath. 
Below the handles: female heads. 

The heads below the handles of the above hydriai, especially no. 408, suggest 

that the following vase, which is decorated with very similar heads should be placed 

here, since it would appear also to be by the Painter of Wurzburg H5739. 

Bell-krater

Eros with phiale of eggs and wreath in 1. hand, fillet in r., flying towards stele, beside 
which sits a half-draped woman, holding an egg in her r. hand, a dish of eggs and a wreath in 
herl. 

(iv) Closely related Vases, perhaps by the painter himself 

The vases in this division are closely related in style to the work of the Painter of 

Wurzburg H5739; those in (a) might even be by his own hand, but those in (b) are 

not sufficiently well preserved to be certain of such an attribution. 

The three following vases are the work of one hand and are closely interconnected by 

the treatment of the drapery borders, which combine dot-stripe with plain black. 

The lower border of the himatia of the two right-hand figures on the reverses of nos. 

413-4 is drawn in a very similar manner; on the youth to left on the latter it breaks 

up in the corner into a series of small black strokes, comparable to those on the piece 

of drapery over the arm of the youth on the reverse of no. 415. The standing woman 

on the obverse of no. 413 should be compared with those on the two skyphoi nos. 

403-4; the hair of the nude youth beside her is done up in a manner similar to that no 

nos. 379, 382 and 385. The obverse of no. 414 has a similar theme to that of no. 383, 

though there the papposilen is better drawn. The draped youth to left on its reverse 

is very like his counterpart on no. 379, where, however, the himation has the typical 

'stepped' border. The himation of the draped woman on the pelike no. 415 has the 

characteristic double curve in the lower right-hand corner, as on nos. 379 and 385 

(cf. Fig. 6 b). All these correspondences in detail suggest that if these vases are not by 

the painter himself, they are the work of a very close imitator.

Neck-amphorae 

*416 Paestum 39125, from Agropoli (Mattene, 1972). Ht. 40. PLATE 128c,/ 
(a) Seated half-draped woman, standing youth with drapery across the lower part of his 
body and over his 1. shoulder, [b) two draped figures, with long hair, Al + Br. 
Neck: (a) and [b) female head.

(a) Draped woman with phiale, nude youth with drapery over 1. arm, [b) draped woman 
with phiale and mirror. 
Neck: (a) and [b) female head. 

No. 416 might also be by the painter himself. The heads on the neck are like 

those on no. 379 and the treatment of the dot-stripes on the drapery is also very 

much in his manner. Unfortunately most of the detail has now disappeared and, in 

consequence, it is not possible to see how the breasts of the half-draped woman were 

treated. No. 417 is even less well preserved, but the standing draped woman is 

comparable with the one on no. 387 and the youth with the corresponding figures on 

nos. 395 and 412. On no. 417 the pictures are framed between reserved bands, but 

not the heads on the neck; on no. 416 the opposite is the case. 

Neck-amphora 

*418 Malibu 80 AE 155,1. (Gift of Dr. and Mrs. S. Silverman). The neck and the right handle are 
missing; ht. to top of body, 34-5; to top of surviving handle, 47-7. PLATE 129 a, b 
VMG, pp. 229-30, no. 105 (ill.). 
(a) Orestes about to slay Clytemnestra; bust of Fury, top r., [b) Bv + A2r. 

This is one of the more interesting of the vases from the Asteas-Python 

workshop, both for subject and style, and it is surprising that as yet no other vase 

seems specifically attributable to the artist who painted it, though it clearly is very 

closely connected with the work of Asteas and of the Painter of Wurzburg H5739. 

The scene on the obverse, which is framed between reserved bands, with a 

triangle in the top left corner, over the crossbar on which a fillet is draped as on nos. 

402 and 405, represents Orestes about to slay his mother Clytemnestra. He is nude, 

except for a chlamys, with embroidered patterns and plain black border, which 

hangs down his back along with a pilos in added white. He has high laced boots and 

stands on rocky ground, his left leg resting on some eminence behind his victim; with 

his right hand he grasps the sword he has drawn from its scabbard, and with his left 

grabs a lock of Clytemnestra's hair, no doubt in readiness to expose her throat to his 

sword. She raises her right hand in a gesture of despairing entreaty, and with her left 

covers her bared right breast. She wears a chiton and has a piece of drapery wrapped 

round the lower part of her body. Both have a large number of fine fold-lines, the 

chiton a central dot-stripe, the other piece of drapery a dot-stripe border. In the top 

right corner appears the bust of a Fury, in huntress costume, with a snake entwined 

in her hair and two others, wrapped round each arm. 

The himatia of the two youths on the reverse also have dot-stripe borders; their 

pose recalls that on nos. 171, 177 and 183 by Asteas or no. 271 by Python, but we 

should note the bent leg of the youth to right, which is drawn much further back 

than would be usual on a vase by either of those two artists. 

The drawing is careful and the fold-lines of the drapery are shown in great 

detail, often appearing in small clusters. In this regard it has elements in common 

with the work of the Painter of Wurzburg H5739: we may compare both the head 

and the drapery of Clytemnestra with those of Makaria on the latter's name vase. 

The Getty amphora, however, is a more powerful piece: it is not overcrowded like 

some of Python's larger vases, it renders a dramatic moment with strong, but not 

over-emphasised, emotion, leaving one with some sense of regret that more works by 

the same hand have not yet come to light. 
3. THE PAINTER OF PAESTUM 21602 

Only two vases can, as yet, be attributed to this painter, a lebes gamik

comparatively elaborate design and a stemless cup. 

Lebes gamikos 

*419 Once Los Angeles Market, Summa Galleries 775. Ht. 42-3. PLATE 129 c, d 
Auction 1, 18 Sept. 1981, no. 30. 
(a) Youth, with cloak round middle of body, holding mirror and fillet, standing draped 
woman, Eros sitting on laver, [b) Eros bending forward in front of standing woman, holding 
fillet. 
Lid�lekanis: (a) female head to r., [b) bird; bowl: (a) female head, [b) bird. 
The picture on (a) is framed between reserved bands decorated with b.f. ivy-leaves, on 
[b) between plain reserved bands. 

Stemless Cup 

*420 Paestum 21602, from C. Andriuolo (1969), T. 58. Ht. 8-5, diam. 32/23. PLATE 129c 
I. Standing draped woman with fillet and mirror, seated nude youth, with branch and 
wreath; stele to r. 
Exergue: white rosette. 

The lebes gamikos, the present whereabouts of which is not known to me, is a 

remarkable vase; the lid was in two main sections, consisting of a lebes gamikos 

resting upon a lekanis; the lid of the upper part is broken and the knob is missing. 

The decoration on both parts consisted of a female head and a bird. The hair on 

each of the heads was bound up with a deep red sphendone; the bird on the lekanis 

portion looks like a duck; the one on the lebes above is speckled, with a circle of dots 

round the eye, perhaps a thrush of some kind. The shoulder on the obverse was 

decorated with plastic female heads, with long hair, the visible flesh being painted 

black; on the reverse are the usual pagoda-like conical knobs. 

The scene on the obverse shows a youth, the central part of whose body is 

covered with a piece of drapery with a wave-pattern border, holding a mirror in his 

right hand and a phiale and red fillet in his left. He faces a woman, draped in a 

peplos, again with a wave-pattern on the overfall and the V-shaped opening at the 

neck; over her left shoulder and down her back falls a piece of drapery which she 

holds with her right hand at her left breast. The upper part of the drapery is covered 

with a mass of small vertical fold-lines running down to the overfall, on which the 

fold-lines bunch in downward-pointing fan-like clusters. On the lower part, they fall 

very straight to the hem, except over the bent left leg, where they appear as short 

horizontal strokes. Besides her is a laver, only half of which is shown; on it sits a small 

Eros, with wings spreading upwards. The ground-line is shown as pebbles, some in 

white, and the youth stands upon a slight eminence. In the top left corner is a long 

fillet in added red, falling vertically to the left and on the right flapping horizontally 

in a wavy line. It is looped over the reserved band beneath the egg-pattern at the top 

of the picture. The design of the reverse is simpler and shows an Eros bending 

forward over his raised left foot in front of a standing draped woman, who wears a 

stephane over her long hair, rather in the manner of the Painter of Wurzburg H 5739 

(cf. nos. 386-7, 389). She is dressed in a long peplos, with overfall, down which runs 

a central double dot-stripe which, rather exceptionally, makes a sweeping curve 

below the overfall, where it passes over the left leg, which is bent at the knee and 

drawn backward. The hair of Eros on the reverse and of the woman on the obverse is 

done up in a bunch at the back, as on many of the vases by the Painter of Wurzburg 

H5739, but without a stephane or white ribbon. The faces of the various figures 

have rather flat profiles. 

Although the influence of Asteas, in particular, and of the Painter of Wurzburg 

H 5739 is very clear in both scenes, the rendering of the drapery is highly individual 

and finds no very close parallel on any of their vases. 

The second vase is a comparatively minor piece and shows a woman, wearing a 

peplos, standing in front of a nude youth seated beside a small stele. Her face and 

hair correspond almost exactly with those of the woman on the obverse of the lebes 

gamikos, just as those of the nude youth do with those of Eros, and there can be little 

doubt that the two vases are the work of a single hand. The rendering of the peplos 

matches that of the woman on the reverse of the lebes, except that now the central 

stripe is plain and falls vertically down to the lower hem. She should also be 

compared with the woman on the obverse of the neck-amphora Paestum 20199 (no. 

380 above), which again underlines the connection with the Painter of Wurzburg 

H5739, but it should be noted that at the neck the peplos on no. 419 assumes a V-

shape, as on no. 418, and lack the 'collar' favoured by the other painter. The cup was 

found together with a lekanis (inv. 21600) which has been associated above with 

Asteas (no. 205). 

Hydria 

*421 Paestum 5397, from C. Andriuolo (1954), T. 2. Ht. 32. PLATE 130a-c 
PAdd, no. A 32. 
Standing draped woman with open box, nude youth, wearing chlamys, with raised foot; 
between them, an owl. 
Below the handles: 1. female head, r. male head wearing pilos. 

Neck-amphora 

*422 Paestum 22450, from C. Andriuolo (1969), T. 102. Ht. 31-5. PLATE 130 d,e 
(a) Nude youth bending forward, drapery over 1. shoulder, to standing draped veiled 
woman; Ionic column in background, [b) Air, with stick, +A2r, with spray. 
Neck: (a) female head, [b) owl. 

In PAdd (p. 5) it was noted in regard to the hydria (no. 421), which was there 

placed in the workshop of Asteas and Python as closely related to the former, that in 

style it 'stands a little apart from the other vases in this group and seems to be the 

work of a new painter, to whom as yet no other vases can be definitely assigned.' We 

now have at least one, and possibly two, other vases by this painter who is an artist of 

no great merit, but is possessed of a very characteristic style, which manifests itself 

particularly in his drawing of the faces. Those of the figures on the body and below 

the handles of the hydria provide excellent illustrations of this. We should note the 

drawing of (i) the eye�three more or less parallel strokes for the brow and upper lid, 

a large black dot for the pupil, (ii) the mouth�deep set, with thick lips and a 

substantial indent above the rounded chin, (iii) the nose�short, curving lines to 

mark the nostril; straight, slightly concave brow-nose line, (iv) the hair�shown as a 

solid black mass, sometimes with straggly curls around the ear. These features will 

also be found on the neck-amphora (no. 422). 

The treatment of the drapery is also noteworthy. On the hydria, the woman 

wears a long peplos, with a central double dot-stripe which falls vertically down to 

the lower hem, her right leg is bent at the knee and over the thigh the fold-lines of the 

drapery are shown as a series of double horizontal strokes, slightly curved; similar 

vertical fold-lines appear on the chlamys of the youth, the small weights at the 

corners of which are clearly shown. The owl between the two is a formidable bird, 

with staring eyes. 

The woman on the obverse of the neck-amphora wears a similar peplos, but has 

a piece of drapery drawn up over her head to serve as a veil, and falling over her left 

shoulder, enveloping her left arm. The chlamys of the youth beside her has a wave-

pattern border. Both stand in front of an Ionic column on a three-stepped base, 

which must represent a tomb-monument, but it is difficult to see the scene as more 

than generic. On the reverse are two draped youths wearing himatia with plain 

black borders�the youth to left finds parallels on vases like nos. 37-8, 42, 87-8, 176, 

by Asteas, whose influence is certainly apparent on both. The drawing of their faces, 

however, places them here. On the neck of the obverse is a female head, wearing a 

radiate stephane, and on the reverse an owl, of somewhat less ferocious aspect than 

on the hydria. Below the handles are superposed palmette-fans, with detached side-

tendrils of a fairly early type (cf. Fig. 3, HID), and the appearance of a somewhat 

similar one on the hydria suggests that these two vases are not very late. 

The hydria comes from a tomb (Andriuolo, 1954, no. 2) which included a 

pelike (inv. 5394) near in style to the Thyrsus Painter, a lebes gamikos (inv. 5398) 

associated with Asteas (no. 200), and a lekanis (inv. 5392) of the Asteas-Python 

Group (no. 635); also several vases decorated in applied red (PAdd, p. 26, nos. 

AR 4�7; see Appendix I), which again come from the Asteas-Python workshop. The 

neck-amphora (no. 422) comes from a tomb which included some of the vases 

associated with the earlier work of Asteas, e.g. nos. 15, 16, 104 above (inv. 22449, 

22443, 22441), which tends to confirm the suggestion of a not unduly late date for 

these vases, probably c. 350 B.C. 

The following vase looks to be closely connected with the above, especially in 

the treatment of the draped youths on its reverse, and it may well be by the same 

hand. 

Bell-krater 

*423 Vienna 4231. Ht. 37, diam. 33. [b) PLATE 130/ 
PPSupp, no. 57, pi. 6 a. 
(a) Bearded silen with torch and phiale running to 1., followed by Dionysos, with phiale 
and thyrsus, drapery over both arms, [b) Bv, with stick (repainted), + variant on A2r. 

In PPSupp this vase was attributed to Asteas, and the obverse is clearly very 

much in his manner, especially in the rendering of the bearded silen (cf. nos. 46, 175, 

181); the reverse, however, differs considerably in style from those of the standard 

Asteas vases, making allowance for the repainted white wreaths round the heads of 

the youths and the curious staff between them, the top of which has been 

transformed into a sort of leafy plant. The drawing of their faces is very like that of 

those of the two figures on the hydria (no. 421), with the same eyes, nose, mouth and 

chin: the youth to left is particularly close. He also finds good parallels on many of 

the bell-kraters associated with Asteas (e.g. nos. 42, 50-1, 61-2, 171, 177), as also 

does the figure of Dionysos on the obverse (cf. with nos. 36, 51-2, 59, 174). All these 

points of resemblance tend to confirm the conclusion that these vases are contempor 

ary with the middle phase of Asteas's activity and seem to be the work of a follower, 

whose drawing of facial features was rather clumsy (cf. also the neck-amphora no. 91 

above, which is near to no. 422, but slightly better drawn). 

The last of the painters to be discussed in this chapter is by far the worst; th

Kurashiki Painter, who takes his name from the museum in Okayama, Japan, which 

possesses one of his bell-kraters (no. 424 below), is an artist of very inferior quality, 

who models his style upon that of Asteas, but with a singular lack of success. In 

PPSupp and PAdd three of the vases now attributed to him were placed in the general 

Asteas Group, but it is clear that all are the work of a single painter, whose manner 

of drawing draped youths is particularly characteristic. Their himatia generally 

have a deep U, with inward curving sides, over the chest, bordered in black; the 

lower borders are plain black and slightly wavy, the fold-lines are clearly indicated 

by rows of parallel lines, and the left hand of the youth to left sticks out beneath the 

drapery. Prototypes will be found on vases like nos. 46-7, 92-3 174-5, but now the 

drawing, especially of the faces, has become very slovenly. It is interesting to contrast 

the Pan on no. 424 a and the bearded silen on no. 425 with those on nos. 39 and 57, 

46, 175 and 181 by Asteas and to see how the Kurashiki Painter has taken over a 

stock type and debased it; the same is equally true of the maenad or the seated 

Dionysos on no. 424, and of the other figures on his obverses.

This chapter lists well over 500 vases of smaller dimensions, grouped into three

sections according to the nature of their decoration. Section 1 deals mainly with 

vases in a great variety of shapes decorated with single figures (woman, youth, satyr, 

Eros, bird, etc.) taken over from larger compositions; it includes a few with two-

figure scenes, which were not specifically attributable to any of the painters discussed 

in Chapters IV-VIII. Section 2 lists those vases decorated only with heads (of 

women, youths, satyrs) and section 3 fish-plates. All these vases are products of the 

Asteas-Python workshop, but in most cases the style is so stereotyped that it is 

extremely difficult to assign a given vase to a specific painter, and they seem more 

probably to be the work of those 'well-drilled associates' to whom reference has 

already been made (p. 55 above). When it seemed feasible to indicate a possible 

closer connection with a known painter, this has been done. 

Some early minor vases which are closely associated with Asteas have already 

been listed in Chapter IV, section 3, nos. 99-124. A few of the later ones (e.g. nos. 

436-7; 442-3) provide a clear connecting link with the early vases connected with' 

the Painter of Naples 2585 (e.g. nos. 3/323-330). 

Bell-kraters 
(a) 

The single figures on either side of the bell-kraters are already familiar to us from the 

larger bell-kraters listed in the preceding chapters. The seated woman on Sydney 

49.10 (no. 428), bunched up in the himation which completely envelops her, is quite 

a popular figure on the minor vases; the Eros on the reverse has a pronounced chin, 

and the same phenomenon may be noted on a number of other vases in this chapter, 

which form a small sub-group around the Sydney krater.

It will be noted that on nos. 427-8 there is no pattern-work below the main 

picture; on nos. 430-1 wave-pattern in black on a reserved stripe with a black band 

and a further reserved stripe above it. Standard framing palmettes are used; on nos. 

427 and 430, the lower fan is sometimes replaced by a single drop-leaf (cf. no. 346). 

On nos. 427 and 430 a large wave-pattern is used under the rim in place of the more 

normal laurel (cf. also nos. 436-8 and the handle-zone on the calyx-krater no. 439).

(c) Later 

The two bell-kraters nos. 436-7 are later than the above and lead directly on t

work of the Painter of Naples 2585, as exemplified in the 'Forerunners' Group (nos. 

3/323-5 below). No. 437 might almost be by the same hand as the neck-amphora 

Paestum 7178 (no. 3/323) and well illustrates the transition to the Painter of Naples 

2585.

(a) Seated woman wrapped in cloak, facing 1., [b) nude youth, with drapery over 1. arm, 
moving to r. and looking I. 

With these two should be compared a fragmentary bell-krater recently found at 

S. Venera (VS 2639) which shows a standing draped woman beside a stele, with a 

'skewer of fruit' in her left hand; to her right is a framing palmette like that on no. 

437. She wears a tunic with a central black stripe, dotted only on the right side (cf. 

the skyphoi nos. 403-4 above, on which, however, the single row of dots moves from 

left to right, as it runs down the peplos). A similar framing palmette appears on 

another fragmentary bell-krater from the same site (VS 1554), but, from what 

remains of the nude woman seated on the obverse, this vase looks closer to the work 

of the Painter of Naples 1778 (cf. nos. 3/85 and 92). 

The following bell-krater, now lost to sight and known only from an old 

drawing, looks as if it might also find a place here, since it has the same wave-pattern 

below the picture and the same single framing palmette as no. 436; the seated half-

draped woman is also comparable to the one on that vase, while the youth (if such it 

be) is close to the one on no. 437.

Neck-amphorae 

Many of the minor vases from the Asteas-Python workshop are neck-amphorae of 

comparatively small size (c. 25 cm. in height). They are decorated with a single 

figure (woman, youth, satyr, Eros) on each side, normally separated by large fan-

palmettes, without any sort of frame. The neck is also decorated with a fan-palmette, 

with outward-curving leaves (contrast those on the amphorae from the Group of 

Naples 2585, where the leaves often curve inwards), and on the shoulder there is a 

band of tongues, sometimes separated from the panel on the neck by wave-pattern or 

zig-zags (e.g. on nos. 441, 455). The women are represented in four ways (PI. 133)� 

(i) enveloped in a cloak, (ii) fully draped, usually wearing a peplos, but without a 

cloak, (iii) half-draped, with the upper part of the body bare and the lower covered 

by a piece of drapery, (iv) completely nude. The drapery often has a dot-stripe 

border or a central stripe. Youths and satyrs are generally shown nude; the former 

sometimes carry a piece of drapery over one arm, and are frequently shown bending 

forward over one raised foot. This type is later copied by the Painter of Naples 2585 

(e.g. no. 3/346), whose early work has a very close affinity to some of the vases listed 

below.

Pelikai 

The minor pelikai are normally of comparatively small size, mostly between 14 an

20 cm. in height. The mouth is wide; the handles come up to and almost touch the 

overhanging rim; the body reaches its maximum width more than half way down, 

and then curves slightly inwards towards a simple disk foot. Above the pictures there 

is either a band of egg-pattern, or a somewhat larger reserved area decorated with 

black tongues; below, there is normally only a reserved stripe. Below the handles are 

large single fan-palmettes without other forms of framing, although there is 

sometimes a tall scroll beside them. The figured decoration closely follows that on 

the neck-amphorae. 

An earlier example of this shape may be seen in Paestum 5639 (no. 116 above), 

associated with Asteas; Naples 85990, connected with the Painter of Wurzburg 

H 5739 (no. 415), is contemporary with the pelikai listed below, and very similar in 

style to several of them.

Hydriai 

The hydriai range in height from 18 to 23 cm., the average being about 20. The neck 

is decorated with laurel, egg-pattern or tongues and the figures generally run up on 

to the shoulder, which is, in consequence, undecorated. Behind the back-handle 

there is normally a single large palmette-fan, sometimes with framing palmettes, 

either beside it or beneath the handles. Female heads do not appear there, but two 

hydriai (nos. 518 and 562) have owls instead. A small stele or altar will often be 

found on one side of the figure. 

The subjects show little variation from those on the neck-amphorae or pelikai. 

The seated half-draped woman and the running or striding nude youth, with a piece 

of drapery over one arm, are very popular. 

(i) With two figures 

The hydria in Japan (no. 518) is known to me only from a photo-copy kindly sent 

by Dr. Akira Mizuta. It looks close in style to the Painter of Wurzburg H5739 to 

judge from the drapery of the seated woman and the drawing of her breasts, but 

without a fuller knowledge of it it seemed safer to place it here. The hydria in 

Paestum (no. 519), though two-figured, is comparatively small; it has no heads 

below the handles and also seemed better placed here.

Professor H. R. W. Smith had already suggested that the Buenos Aires hydria 

belonged to the Python area and that it was 'probably by his own hand'. The figure 

may well be intended to represent Dionysos.

Lebetes gamikoi 

The lebes gamikos is, as we have seen, a popular shape at Paestum, and some of the 

larger examples have very elaborate lids, consisting of three or four different 

elements. On the minor vases the lids are much simpler and fall into two main 

types�(i) with a small lebes on top connected by a stem to a lekanis-like lid, (ii) a 

simple lid, like that of a lekanis, with a tall knob, which assumes various shapes. With 

the former the pictures are usually framed between reserved bands, on the latter they 

simply stand between the large palmette-fans below the handles, as on the pelikai. 

The plastic heads which appeared on the shoulders of the larger lebetes gamikoi are 

no longer found; conical knobs are sometimes used (e.g. on nos. 565, 567), or a very 

small protuberance (as on nos. 566, 569), but in general there is nothing at all on the 

shoulder beyond the ornamental pattern-work, usually tongues. 

(i) With more elaborate lids and framed pictures

(a) 

The two lebetes gamikoi in this sub-division are slightly larger than the others, but 

are placed here because their poor state of preservation makes a more positive 

attribution rather difficult. Paestum 21595 (no. 565) might well be by the Painter of 

Wurzburg H5739; the draped woman is close to the one on Paestum 21568 (no. 

403), and the stopping short of the framing band by a palmette scroll before it 

reaches the bottom of the picture occurred also on nos. 379-80. The other lebes 

gamikos (no. 566) is not very far away from it in style.

reverse is the prototype of those on vases like Paestum 1275, 32866, but there the drawing is 
coarser.

Reference may here be made to a remarkable lebes gamikos (ht. 25) found in 

the excavations in the Contrada Spina-Gaudo on May 24, 1975. On the obverse was 

a seated woman and on the reverse a standing youth. The surface of the vase was at 

some later date completely overpainted in white and redecorated, extending the 

figured area by cutting off the side leaves of the fan-palmettes below the handles, and 

adding a new vertical frame. Most of the new decoration has now worn off but 

substantial traces of it remain, especially on the reverse. At the same time the lid was 

decorated with black rays on a white background.

Lekanides 

With the exception of Paestum 32115 (no. 623), which is placed here because its 

poor state of preservation makes a more precise attribution almost impossible, the 

lekanides are decorated on the lid with two figures, in various different combinations 

taken from the repertory of woman, youth, satyr, Eros, siren, bird, hound and female 

head. The two figures are often separated by some form of palmette, plant or scroll, 

but at times it looks as if they are intended to be in a closer association�pursuit, 

conversation, etc. The standard pattern on the outer rim of the lid is wave and, on 

the bowl below, tongues. The knob of the lid is usually decorated with fan-palmettes 

in black-figure, frequently accompanied by from one to three black dots on either 

side. Ground is sometimes shown as undulating, with black and white dots, at others 

by a wavy line in added white.

(ii) With a figure (woman, youth, Eros, satyr) on one side and a bird on the oth

Various types of bird appear on these lids and because of the high degree of 

stylisation they are not easy to identify. The one on no. 631 must be a predator of 

some kind in view of its curved beak (cf. the bird below the handle on the Asteas 

hydria, no. 134). Another bird which appears quite frequently has a speckled body, 

a series of black stripes, slightly curved, running down its wing, and a tail, either 

solid black (as on no. 634) or banded like its wing (as on no. 635). White dots may 

also be used on its body, which is sometimes outlined in white (as on no. 638); the eye 

is a black circle, with a large dot in the centre, and it is often surrounded by a ring of 

dots outside. It may be some form of speckled thrush, but the possibility of its being a 

wryneck (!uy�) should not be excluded, since it is not unlike the illustration of that 

bird given in D'Arcy Thompson's Glossary on p. 124, and it would be a not 

inappropriate bird in this sort of context. Some of the other birds look not unlike one 

of the various varieties of partridge, especially the francolin or black partridge as 

illustrated by John Pollard in Birds in Greek Life and Myth, on pi. 20, after a painting 

by Henry Jones (see pp. 50 f. of his text). The bird on Paestum 1245 (no. 646), while 

resembling no. 638 in body, has a long pointed beak and may be some form of 

honey-eater (cf. no. 651). 

Sometimes there is what looks like a string of beads hanging down from the 

mouth of the bird (e.g. no. 638), or else it holds a small worm (nos. 642, 648; cf. the 

duck on Louvre K244 by Python = no. 306). 

As the reverses of all the lids listed below represent a bird of some kind, only the 

obverse design is given, except in special cases.

The palmette-scrolls between the youth and the bird suggest that it should be dated 
fairly early.

To judge from the palmette tendrils on nos. 665-6, these two lekanides should come 

fairly early in the series. The same bird appears on each (as on nos. 634 and 644) and 

they look to be the work of one painter. The heads may be compared with some of 

those below the handles of the hydriai associated with Asteas (e.g. nos. 68 ff), but the 

eyes are here treated in a very different fashion, the pupils being mere strokes instead

By the same hand as this lekanis are three others which, as they are decorated 

solely with female heads, have been placed in Section 2. They are Paestum 1254, 

20294 and 26639 (nos. 826-828 below). Paestum 20294 comes from C. Licinella 

(1967), T. 13 along with the vases of the Aphrodite Painter; it is possible that it is by 

his hand also, but the head on it does not correspond very closely with those on his 

other vases. In any case the Aphrodite Painter must have worked together with 

Asteas and Python (see Chapter X). 

Lekanis lids (small or fragmentary) 

In the Magazzino of the Museum at Paestum there are several small or fragmentary 

lekanis lids from the area of the Heraion, decorated with female heads or birds. They 

are listed in PAdd on p. 8 as nos. A93-A97 (= NF 13-17), and are placed here 

because the presence of the birds on nos. 674 and 678 links them with the vases in the 

preceding divisions.

Lekythoi (squat) 

In style and treatment the squat lekythoi, which number about 50, follow the other 

minor vases very closely. Only two (nos. 680-1) with more than single-figure 

compositions are listed here; both these are ill preserved, and since that makes a 

more definite attribution difficult, it seems safer to place them here, as has been done 

with other shapes in a similar poor condition.

Oenochoai 

Much the most common form of oenochoe is shape 3�the comparatively small 

trefoil variety, often referred to as a chous. There are a few examples of shapes 1 and 

6, but other forms are very rare. On shape 1 see the article by J. R. Green, 'Some 

Classes of oenochoe of the first half of the 5th century B.C.' in AA 1978, pp. 262-72, 

and on choes his article in BSA 66, 1971, pp. 189-228; although these two works deal 

primarily with Attic, they contain many relevant observations on these shapes for 

South Italian. It is noteworthy that shape 8 in its various forms does not seem to 

occur at Paestum, though it is particularly common in Apulian. 

The nude male figure, usually with a piece of dot-stripe bordered drapery over 

one arm or across his body, who is depicted on many of these vases, often with a 

'skewer of fruit' or a thyrsus, may well be intended to represent Dionysos, especially 

when he has long hair, as on so many of the larger vases. Satyrs or silens appear with 

comparative frequency, but the rarity of female figures is remarkable.

unfortunately a different numbering system is adopted and the shapes not very clearly distinguished.

(c) With phlyax masks 

These two choes are of particular interest for the phlyax masks depicted upon t

since, although such masks frequently appear on Apulian vases of this shape (see 

Phlyax Vases, nos. 153-66), these are the only known examples from one of the other 

South Italian fabrics. The Pontecagnano chous (no. 772) shows a mask of Type B, 

with a wreath round the head; the eyebrow is strongly arched; the nose snub and 

slightly turned up. It is comparable to the masks worn by the phlyakes on Madrid 

11060 (no. 64) by Asteas or on Liverpool M 10711 (no. 281) and Schneider-

Herrmann coll. 136 (no. 284) by Python. The mask on no. 773 is bald on top, but 

otherwise similar, and is probably Type P or the Maison. Here the eyebrow is also 

strongly arched and the space between it and the upper eyelid has been highlighted 

in added white. The fan-palmette below the handles has sprung leaves, which 

suggests a fairly late date.

Oenochoai (shape 6) 

This shape, which is more common in Etruscan than in South Italian, seems to be

derived from a metal prototype (see Green in Antiquities, p. 68). The figured 

decoration is placed on the shoulder, the lower part is decorated with laurel, except 

on no. 774, where it is ivy.

Guttus

786 Swiss private coll. Ht. 7-1. 
Schauenburg, RM 83, 1976, pi. 79. 
Bird and lion, with plastic head as spout. 

The guttus is a rare shape at Paestum (cf. inv. 20302 = no. 967 by the 

Aphrodite Painter, with a normal spout), and this is the only example in which the 

spout takes the form of a plastic lion-head attached to a body painted in the r.f. 

technique, although this is a common practice with Athenian gutti. In the centre is a 

gorgeoneion in relief, painted black. Beside the spout, to right, is a small palmette-

scroll of the type found on fairly early Paestan vases and the bird, which is probably 

a thrush, is drawn in the typical Paestan fashion, with a row of dots along its body, 

dotted wings and a striped tail. 

Guttus (with perforated top, ring handle, and lion spout) 

*787 Paestum 31755, from C. Vannullo (1975), T. 5. Ht. 6-5, diam. 9-2. PLATE 141 c 
Two hounds and a small bird. 

This guttus is of a completely different shape; it has a cylindrical body, 

decorated with berried ivy, rather like that of the normal epichysis, with two hounds 

and a bird on top. There is a high ring-handle, a plastic lion spout, and the central 

area of the body has a perforated depression surrounded by a raised border, painted 

black. 

The provenience, the use of the berried ivy-pattern and the rendering of the 

hounds (cf. nos. 655-6, particularly the former) all point to the vase as Paestan, but 

there is no other example of this shape in the fabric. The small bird is comparable to 

K. Schauenburg, in his article 'Askoi mit plastischem Lowenkopf" in RM 83, 1976, pp. 261-71, 

discusses this vase in some detail, with a number of Attic parallels. See also F. Gilotta, Gutti e Askoi a 

rilievo italioti ed etruschi (Rome, 1985), where gutti with gorgoneia are discussed on p. 9 ff. A full study o

Apulian gutti and askoi will be found in Marie-Odile Jentel, Les gutti et les askoi a reliefs etrusques e

apuliens (Leiden, 1976). 

the one on no. 786, but has a row of white dots down the outside of its body and a 

white outline to the top of its wing. 

Skyphoi (of Corinthian shape) 

The skyphos of Corinthian shape is far more common for the smaller vases than t

standard variety. These skyphoi invariably have a large fan-palmette below each 

handle; frames of various kinds are used for the pictures: reserved bands as on nos. 

788-91, standard framing palmettes (no. 792) or a simplified version of them, in 

which there is only one fan at the top, pointing downwards (e.g. nos. 794�5), a tall 

scroll with a single drop-leaf (as on nos. 816-8), or no frame at all (no. 819). The 

area below the picture, where the body joins the foot, is normally left reserved and is 

sometimes decorated with a black band of varying thickness or in a few instances 

with wave-pattern as well. The rim at the top is usually undecorated, but 

occasionally (e.g. nos. 788-9) there is a band of egg-pattern.

Small fragments 

In the Magazzino of the Museum at Paestum there are numerous small fragments 

from the excavations in the area of the Heraion, many of which must have been 

products of the workshop of Asteas and Python. The more significant ones have been 

discussed in the appropriate place, those listed below are comparatively trivial and 

included only for the sake of completeness.

There is a substantial number of Paestan vases on which the sole decoration is a

head, that of a woman on the overwhelming majority, with only an occasional male 

head�youth or Dionysos, satyr, Eros. Many of these vases have come to light only in 

recent years as a result of the excavations carried out in Paestum; they have enabled 

us to identify as Paestan a few others which had previously been attributed to other 

fabrics. On most of the women's heads the hair is bound up in either a sphendone or a 

kekryphalos, saccoi are comparatively rare; the headdress is decorated either in a very 

simple manner (i.e. with a row of black dots) or more elaborately with rows of black 

and white dots, and a radiate stephane is often worn in conjunction with it. 

Somewhat similar heads will be found on the necks of amphorae and beneath the 

handles of hydriai associated with Asteas and Python where, however, they tend to 

be rather better drawn. One cannot be sure that the heads on such vases were always 

the work of the painter who was responsible for the main scenes on the vase, since 

other artists might well have been employed for such a purpose; indeed, the 

uniformity in the treatment of many of the heads on vases by Asteas or Python and 

the difficulty of drawing clear distinctions between them may well support such a 

theory. 

Vases decorated only with heads are far from easy to classify, since they often 

contain few individual elements which would enable an immediate recognition of 

the artist who painted them, and they have, in consequence, been grouped below 

mainly on the grounds of similarity of treatment. It is also difficult to determine at 

what precise point a female head ceases to belong to the Asteas-Python workshop 

and moves into that of the Painter either of Naples 1778 or of Naples 2585. These 

two painters were close followers of Python and Asteas respectively, and the heads on 

their earliest vases are still remarkably like many of those which have been placed in 

the present section. To draw a hard and fast dividing line is not feasible and some of 

the transitional vases might equally well be placed here or in Chapters XI and XII, 

since they merely mark the slow emergence of the styles of the two later artists from 

the fairly standard one of the Asteas-Python workshop, a process equally visible in 

the larger vases (e.g. in Naples 1778-9 for the Painter of Naples 1778 or Paestum 

5184 for the Painter of Naples 2585). 

(i) The Painter of Leipzig T 4740 

Reference has already been made to this painter in connection with the lekanis in 

Leipzig (T4740; no. 673 above) which was decorated with (a) female head and (b) 

swan, and was therefore listed with the other lekanides with similar decoration in 

Section 1. The female head on the Leipzig lekanis is repeated on three other vases of 

the same shape, one of which was found in Tomb 13 in the 1967 excavations in the 

Contrada Licinella at Paestum, along with a number of vases by the Aphrodite 

Painter (see Chapter X), who certainly worked in collaboration with Asteas and 

Python. The heads are comparatively simple; the hair is done up in a black-dotted 

sphendone; there is a white stephane across the hair above the brow and a large bunch 

of hair at the back. The pupil of the eye is either a stroke or a small dot; the lips are 

not unduly emphasised. On all the lids there are palmette-fans with sprung leaves; 

the outer edge is decorated with wave-pattern on the Leipzig lekanis and on no. 826; 

with chevrons on no. 827 and the lekanis portion of 828. No. 828 comes from Tomb 2 

in the Contrada Gaudo (1972) and joins on to a small lebes gamikos, so that the two 

combined to form the lid of a much larger lebes gamikos which might possibly have 

been 26638. The number 26630 which seems to have been given to the upper portion 

is not applicable since it had a lid of quite different form (see above p. 117, no. 155).

lebes gamikos 26638 (no. 155 above). 

(ii) Vases with female heads in the manner of Python 

The following four vases, which are the work of one painter, are decorated with 

heads very much in the manner of Python, even to a touch of pink on the cheek, as 

on his signed neck-amphora. On all of them the hair is bound up in a sphendone, 

decorated with rows of dots, both black and white. A substantial bunch of black hair 

emerges at the back and there is a solid mass just above the brow, ending in curling 

locks which run down to just below the ear. The mouth is slightly open, with a 

downward curve; the chin is rounded, but not over-emphasised; the pupil of the eye 

is a black dot. There is a white bead necklace, and the head is cut off immediately 

below the neck. The three small lebetes gamikoi are similar in shape and pattern-

work; on no. 829 round the rim of the lid there is a band of reserved squares with a 

central dot, which is repeated on the knobbed lid of no. 832. It is a pattern which will 

reappear on some later Paestan vases.

tambourine. 
The face of the woman, whose hair is bound up in a sphendone with a single row of black 
dots, has been somewhat abraded, so that the details of the mouth and chin are missing but 
the head should be compared with that on no. 831; the face of Eros recalls those on nos. 721 
and the exterior of no. 813. The two heads are separated by fan-palmettes. 

(iii) The Heavy Chin Group 

This Group includes a number of smaller vases of various shapes decorated with 

heads both of women and of youths, one characteristic of which is the emphasis 

placed on the chin, which is large and rounded. The deep indent between it and the 

lower lip gives it an even greater prominence. Such heavy chins will also be seen on 

the heads below the handles of hydriai and on the necks of amphorae by Asteas and 

Python, and particularly on the hydriai of the Painter of Wurzburg H 5739, though 

not quite to the same extent as on some of these vases (e.g. Paestum 5046 = no. 837). 

The lips also are generally rather thick, the mouth, which is closed, is shown as a 

black line, with a slight downward curve. The hair of women is bound up in a 

sphendone, with the usual black and white dots on it, and the chignon may be tied 

round with a white ribbon (as on no. 836). The heads of youths generally have a 

white leafy wreath around them; the hair is mostly shown as a solid mass, with a few 

straggly curls around the ear. The eye has three parallel strokes above, the pupil is 

normally a thick stroke (in contrast to the more normal black dot on the heads on 

larger vases), the lower eyelid meets the upper at an acute angle. Many of the 

lekanides have one large fan-palmette, with a scroll balancing it; sometimes there are 

two of either. 

The chous 834 is of some interest, since it seems to represent a head of Dionysos 

rather than just a youth. Such a treatment of the long hair, the dotted fillet tied 

around the head and decorated with white ivy-leaves is very commonly used for 

Dionysos on the vases of Asteas and Python; the present one seems slightly nearer to 

the style of the latter painter to judge from his Dionysos heads on the reverses of his 

two signed vases (nos. 239^0) and of nos. 244�5.

This and the preceding lekanis are moving close to the style of the Painter of 

Naples 2585 (cf. Paestum 4834-5, 6029 and 5205 = nos. 3/337-340 below), which 

have been grouped with that artist largely because they show his very characteristic 

treatment of the hair beside the ear; nos. 835-7 also do not have sprung leaves on the 

fan-palmette, which are normal with the Painter of Naples 2585 (though they are 

also used on the vases by the Painter of Leipzig T 4740).

Neck-amphorae 

These three neck-amphorae look to be by a single hand and are close in style to nos. 

835-7 above. On Pontecagnano 36182 (no. 845) the neck is left reserved and 

decorated with black stripes, the shoulder likewise with wave-pattern. On the other 

two, which come from the same tomb and make an almost matching pair, there are 

black tongues on the reserved neck, which come down on to the shoulder, which is 

scalloped where the tongues meet it. On the first there is a normal palmette-fan 

below the handles; on the other two it has sprung leaves. The chins are very massive.

condition and the head on [b) has mostly disappeared, and (ii) an oenochoe 22340 with the 
head of a youth. 

The following amphora (no. 848) is similar in shape to nos. 845-7 and has 

tongues on the neck in a reserved panel with a scalloped lower edge, as on nos. 

846-7; beneath the handles are fan-palmettes with outward-curving leaves (cf. no. 

845). The two heads, however, are treated in a very different manner; both have 

very long eyebrows and eyelids, the pupil of the eye is a large black dot and the hair 

assumes a conical rather than a rounded look. Both heads would seem to be those of 

women, despite the fact that the one on the reverse does not wear a headdress; there 

is, however, no sign of the neck muscle which appears on the male heads on nos. 

845-7. The lips and chin, especially on the obverse, are much as on the other vases in 

this division and the amphora is probably best placed here, though it is the work of a 

different hand, to which as yet no other vases seem attributable.

(iv) Vases decorated with heads in the 'Plain' Style 

The 'Plain' style as applied to the heads, mostly of women, which appear on the 

vases below, refers to the fact that on them the hair is normally caught up in a very 

simple sphendone, which is decorated only with a single row of black dots. Very little 

added white is used except for a stephane above the brow. The rows of black and 

white beads, which appeared on the head-dresses in the preceding group, do not 

normally occur here. A large, solid bunch of black hair projects at the back; there are 

curling locks (sometimes only a single lock) in front of and below the visible ear. The 

type of head on these vases differs slightly from that in the previous division; the lips 

are less full, and not quite so much emphasis is placed on the chin. The back hair has 

a fairly wide reserved area around it. The heads on these vases lead directly on to 

those by the Painter of Naples 2585 (see chapter XII below).

Reference has already been made (p. 200) to the similarity between the female head 

on the lid of a lebes gamikos once on the Cologne market (no. 567) and those on 

Madrid 11261 (no. 912). By the same hand is the head on a squat lekythos in 

Braunschweig (no. 913); a small portion of the shoulders is also shown, and this is 

characteristically decorated with the curving fold-lines of the upper part of the 

peplos. These heads lead on to those by the Painter of Naples 1778, as seen on Naples 

739, Paestum 5197 and related vases, but they are perhaps better placed here in view 

of their similarity to the head on no. 567, which is clearly a product of the Asteas-

Python workshop.

3. FISH-PLATES

See, in particular, Ian McPhee and A. D. Trendall, Greek Red-figured Fish-plate

(= GRFP), where the Paestan fish-plates are listed and discussed in Part III. A brief 

The identifications of the fish here given are taken from GRFP and based on those in Alan 

Davidson, Mediterranean Seafood (Penguin, ed. 3, 1987) and in A. Palombi and M. Santarelli, Gli animali 

commestibili dei mari d'Italia (ed. 4, 1979). The fish-plates in the Naples Museum are discussed by 

Palombi in an article in Atti Ace. Pontaniana, n.s. 23, 1974, pp. 168-80 ( = Palombi, Napoli). 

preliminary study will also be found in PAdd, pp. 12-13, but the classifications there 

given have now been considerably modified as a result of subsequent discoveries at 

Paestum. 

As with the larger vases, the antecedents of Paestan fish-plates are to be foun

group of plates mainly from Sicily and southern Calabria (see GRFP, Part I), many 

of which have the dotted outer border, which is very typical of Paestan, and some 

(e.g. Morgantina 57.960, Reggio 19184, Locri C 69-74) the ivy-pattern on the 

overhanging rim which will also be found on several Paestan fish-plates from the 

Asteas-Python workshop (cf. the rims of kraters by Asteas and Python), although it 

rarely occurs on those of other fabrics. 

Paestan fish-plates as a whole are remarkably coherent in style and treatment. 

They may be divided into three main groups, partly on stylistic grounds and partly 

by their contexts: one is clearly associated with the workshop of Asteas and Python, 

one with their later follower�the Painter of Naples 2585�and the third with the 

Painter of Naples 1778, who is closely connected with the Campanian workshop of 

the Laghetto and Caivano Painters. It also seems probable that at least one plate 

(Paestum 5657) is to be assigned to the Apulianising phase. Several of the plates are 

of comparatively large size (over 25 cm. in diameter) and include some of the finest 

of those made in South Italy (e.g. Paestum 4802, Naples 2550, Princeton 79.3, 

Toledo 77-30). The larger plates are regularly decorated with four or more big fish 

and a number of smaller ones, as well as a variety of marine creatures like prawns, 

scallops or mussels; among the bigger fish, the dogfish and red or grey mullet are 

popular, and typical of Paestan is an octopus of 'strange beauty' with large eyes (in 

black with a white outline) and thick, writhing tentacles with white suckers, poised 

above the central depression (e.g. Naples 2550, Princeton 79.3, Toledo 77.30, 

Paestam 26651, 20298, 32130). The standard smaller plate is normally decorated 

with three fish�perch or bream or mullet, with perhaps a squid or a torpedo. 

Noteworthy is the Paestan fondness for stripes and dots on the bodies of the fish and, 

in particular, for a circle of dots round the eyes, for which a good parallel will be 

found on the eyes of the birds which appear on many Paestan vases. 

The central depression is never decorated inside, being left either reserved or 

else painted black, in the latter case often with a reserved band around it, decorated 

with wave-pattern, strokes or, in one instance, with squares with a central dot. 

There can be little doubt that the fish-plates in this section are products of the 

workshop of Asteas and Python, since several of them come from tombs in Paestum 

or the vicinity which contained other vases either by Asteas or from his workshop. 

4802 comes from Tomb 2 in the Contrada Gaudo (1957) and was found together 

with the squat lekythos showing the purification of Orestes at Delphi (4794) and a 

cup showing a seated woman (4807), both attributed to Asteas himself. The fish 

plate from Agropoli (20188) was found together with the Stheneboia hydria 

(20202), signed by Asteas, and several other r.f. vases (20198-9, 20201, 20161), 

which are either by the painter himself or very close to him in style and which are 

discussed in detail by Bottini and Greco in Dial, di Arch. 8, 1974�5, pp. 250-61. The 

three fish-plates 39126, 6113, 22325 were all found along with vases of the Asteas 

Group, as also were 6561, 22256, 22782 in division (ii). The connection, therefore, 

between the fish-plates and the Asteas-Python workshop seems to be definitely 

established. 

(i) 

The plates in this division are still close in style and treatment to those in the 

Campanian Torpedo Group (GRFP, HE), and we may note the frequency with 

which various types of striped fish occur (as in that group), as well as the presence of 

a 'compressed' octopus (cf. GRFP, nos. IIE/30-1) and of a squid (cf. GRFP, nos. 

IIE/29-30). Noteworthy also is the use of a dotted outer border on all the plates. 

The fish most frequently represented are striped perch, two-banded bream, 

wrasse and mullet and a very extensive use of dots is made on the bodies of the fish. 

We may note also the repetition here of the line of dots running along the head of the 

fish from the start of the dorsal fin to the mouth (cf. GRFP, nos. IIE/1, 5, 10, 12 in the 

Torpedo Group). 

The eyes consist of a black disk edged with white; gills are shown in white, 

sometimes with black also, and the pectoral fin radiates upwards from them, usually 

with a semi-circle or circle at the base. The end of the tail may be marked by a row of 

white strokes or dots. 

The Chamay plate is of particularly high quality, especially in the rendering of 

the dogfish and the octopus, which here takes up the typical Paestan position of 

resting, as it were, against the border of the depression; it is the forerunner of the 

more elaborately decorated fish-plates in division (iii). 

(a) 

The three plates in this sub-division are rather larger and more elaborately 

decorated than those in (b), although the individual fish depicted upon them 

(wrasse, striped perch, etc.) are very much the same.

The plates in this sub-division are of slightly smaller dimensions and form a very 

coherent group. All are decorated with three fish, one of which is almost invariably a 

striped perch or bream and another some variety of wrasse. Mullet also make an 

appearance, the red variety, with its characteristically-shaped head, on Salerno PC 

1322, the grey on Madrid 11374 (perhaps also on no. 930, though here it looks more 

like a bass). Several plates have a band of wave-pattern round the central depression 

(e.g. Madrid 11368, 11374, Leningrad 376), and either laurel or wave appears on 

the overhanging rim.

The plates in this division, while still close in style to those in the precedi

slightly from them in their drawing of the fish, the dots on their bodies being smaller 

and rather less emphasised. Again the general treatment is very uniform and most of 

the plates seem to be the work of a single painter, who must have been a member of 

the Asteas workshop since nos. 20144, 22256 and 22782 were found in conjunction 

with minor vases of that group. The torpedoes on Madrid 11371 and Paestum 22256 

are similar and might be compared with that on the Apulianising plate Paestum 

5657 below; the sparus auratus on Madrid 11367 is also connected with that on Fogg 

25.30.55. The stripes or dots go right down on to the tails of the fish.

(iii) 

This division contains the finest of all the Paestan fish-plates and they have few rivals 

in either Campanian or Apulian. They are of rather larger size, ranging from 27 to 

33 cm. in diameter and all depict both large and small fish, together with a variety of 

marine creatures. All have ivy on the overhanging rim and, with the single exception 

of Paestum 26651, wave-pattern round the central depression. The outer border is 

decorated with a reserved band with dots, except on Toledo 77.30 where it consists of 

alternating black and reserved rectangles, and on Paestum 20298 where there is 

wave-pattern. 

Noteworthy is the presence of a very characteristic octopus with dome-like 

body, large eyes and eight waving tentacles with white suckers on them. They recall 

the rather more compressed octopus on Berlin F 3607 and the plate on the Swiss 

market, which were placed in the Torpedo Group (GRFP, IIE/30-1) and which, as 

was there pointed out, are extremely close in style to Paestan; further variants on the 

octopus motif will be seen on the plates associated with the Painter of Naples 1778. 

Another remarkable fish is shown in a leaping attitude on the plates in Toledo 

and Perugia; despite a superficial resemblance to a gurnard (see D'Arcy Thompson, 

Glossary, p. 120), especially in the head and eye, it is more probably a red mullet (op. 

cit., p. 265), since the fins and barbels, as well as the tail, correspond more closely 

with those of that fish. 

Paestum 20298 comes from Tomb 13 of the 1967 excavations in the Contrada 

Licinella, which also contained three large vases by the Aphrodite Painter�the 

neck-amphora from which he took his name, the oenochoe with the Judgment of 

Paris and a lebes gamikos with a bridal scene�together with a number of smaller 

ones, most of which may also be attributed to his hand. The entire tomb-group is 

published by Emanuele Greco in II Pittore di Afrodite and is discussed, together with a 

number of other vases newly attributed to this painter, in Chapter X below. It is 

possible that the fish-plate, with which was found a small black-glazed receptacle of 

the type often referred to as a 'salt-cellar' (Greco, pi. 26 b) and which fits neatly into 

the central depression, was also painted by the Aphrodite Painter, since it is clear 

that he worked in close collaboration with Asteas and was greatly influenced by him, 

as may be seen from a comparison between their two oenochoai with the Judgment 

of Paris (20295 by the former; 26631 by the latter, from Contrada Gaudo (1972), T. 

2)-

Naples 2550, Princeton 79.3, Toledo 77.30 and Perugia (private coll.) all look 

to be the work of one painter, who might well be Asteas himself. It is perhaps worth 

noting that Paestum 20298 shows slight variations from the normal patternwork, in 

that the outer border is decorated with wave, which does not figure round the 

central depression.

It is not too much to say that the discovery in 1967 of Tomb 13 in the excavati

the Contrada Licinella opened a new chapter in the history of Paestan pottery. The 

contents of this tomb included a number of vases by an artist, not previously 

identified, to whom the name of the Aphrodite Painter was given after the subject of 

his most important work (no. 963). He is a painter of the highest significance, since 

he was the first of the Apulianising artists at Paestum and his work has been studied 

in some detail by Emanuele Greco in his monograph // Pittore di Afrodite (hereafter 

referred to as PdA). He seems to have come to Paestum between c. 340 and 330 B.C., 

probably about the same time as the Apulianising phase begins to manifest itself in 

the fabric of Cumae in Campania (LCS, pp. 495 ff.; Suppl. Ill, pp. 233 ff.) 

The Aphrodite Painter must have had an Apulian background and training, 

since he brought with him to Paestum a number of essentially Apulian stylistic 

features, which are manifest in the three principal vases from Tomb 13; among them 

we may note, in particular, the following: 

(i) the elaborate floral and ornamental patterns. These are very much in 

evidence on the neck-amphora (no. 963), but are also to be seen on the oenochoe 

(no. 964), especially on the neck and below the handles; 

(ii) the presence in the left hand of Aphrodite on no. 964 of the so-called 

'xylophone', which is certainly of Apulian, and probably Tarentine, origin (cf. also 

no. 972); 

(iii) the appearance of'hollow rocks', like those upon which the woman on the 

neck of the amphora (no. 963), or on the reverse of the lebes gamikos (no. 965), is 

seated; 

(iv) the extensive use of added colours, especially on the main scenes on no. 963. 

These are in a purely polychrome style, as on the Gnathia vases in Apulian, or on 

some of the floral settings around the heads or figures on the necks of Apulian volute -

kraters. 

On his coming to Paestum, the Aphrodite Painter seems to have joined the 

workshop of Asteas and Python and, under their influence, soon begins to paestanise. 

Evidence for the connection between them is provided by the finding in the same 

tomb (Contrada Gaudo, 1972, T. 2) of a hydria by the Aphrodite Painter (no. 978), 

along with a group of vases (nos. 151-6 above) attributed to Asteas, which included 

'On the so-called 'xylophone' see, in particular, RVAp I, pp. 315-6, 404; H. R. W. Smith, Funerary 

Symbolism, pp. 130-2, where it is suggested that it might be the platage of Archytas; Schneider-

pp. 476-7. The squat lekythos in Essen [RVAp I, p. 404, no. 15/44a), which shows a woman playing the 

instrument, has recently been republished by Heide Froning, Katalog der gr. und ital. Vasen, pp. 244�9, 

no. 89 (with bibliography) and by Anneliese Kossatz-Deissman in AA 1985, p. 241, fig. 22. It is 

exceedingly common on Apulian vases, but is found in Campanian and Paestan only in the 

Apulianizing phase. 

an oenochoe with the Judgment of Paris (no. 151�cf. with no. 964). The neck-

amphora (no. 963) - a shape not found in Apulian at this period�is very similar to 

the one signed by Python (no. 240) and is made from the same clay. The effects of 

working in a Paestan environment are clear from the following: 

(i) the framing of the pictures�the scene on the neck of the obverse of no. 963 

has a reserved framing band, with a triangle at the top, on the left-hand side only; on 

the reverse the seated woman is framed between palmettes, but not of the 

characteristic Paestan type. These, however, are to be found on a few of the 

Aphrodite Painter's vases, like no. 995, and on a couple of his hydriai, where they 

appear between the fan-palmette below the back-handle and the heads beneath the 

side-handles (as on nos. 979-80). Framing bands are used more frequently, either 

with or without triangles at the top, especially on lebetes gamikoi (e.g. nos. 974, 

976-7) and hydriai (nos. 978-80); cf. also nos. 991-2; 

(ii) the choice of shapes�in particular, the neck-amphora with panels on the 

neck containing either figured scenes or female heads; the lebes gamikos, with the 

typical elaborate, multiple lid (nos. 965, 969, 976), so typical of Paestan; the ring 

askos (no. 968; cf. Paestum 26635, no. 154 by Asteas); the hydriai with female heads 

below the handles, the presence of which is not in accord with the regular practice in 

Apulia; 

(iii) the ornamental and drapery patterns�the berried ivy below the rim on the 

obverse of no. 971, changing to laurel on the reverse; the 'Asteas flowers' on nos. 973 

and 977; the chequer pattern on the drapery (e.g. nos. 964, 970, 972); the dot-stripe 

borders to the himatia of the youths on the reverses of nos. 970-1; the vertical stripes, 

black or black and white, running down the peploi�on no. 972 with a wave-pattern 

border after the manner of Python. 

We should also note the 'skewer of fruit', held by the seated woman on the 

reverse of no. 965, and the Furies in the windows on no. 971; although both these 

devices are found in Apulian, they are much more characteristic of Paestan; cf. also 

the row of white objects (eggs?) on the laps of seated women (as on nos. 963, 972, 

976-7, 981, 985, 992-3). 

In all these elements we see the influence of Asteas and Python upon the work of 

an Apulian new-comer, and the vases of the Aphrodite Painter afford a splendid 

example of the grafting of one style upon another, to produce something that is a 

combination of both, in contrast to most of the later Apulianising vases in Chapter 

XIII where Apulian elements predominate and on which the influence of Paestan 

appears to a markedly smaller extent. 

As a result of the discovery of the vases by the Aphrodite Painter in Tomb 13, it 

has been possible to attribute a substantial number of other vases, some of 

considerable interest, to his hand, and he emerges as one of the more significant 

Paestan vase-painters. Several of the smaller vases now attributed to him were 

already known and mostly placed in the area of the Asteas-Python workshop, but 

now that the distinguishing features of his style have become apparent they can be 

transferred to where they rightly belong.

We may begin by looking at the three large vases from Tomb 13 in the Contrada 

Licinella; as they have already been discussed in some detail by Emanuele Greco 

and subsequently republished on many occasions, there is little need here to repeat a 

great deal of what has already been written about them.

We have already noted the general resemblance in shape between the Aph 

rodite amphora and the one signed by Python (no. 240 above), though the latter is 

only about two-thirds its size and is decorated with more conventional patterns; 

perhaps the unusual height of the former is a reflection of the Apulian fondness for 

vases of large dimensions, now transferred to a non-Apulian shape. The ornamental 

patterns owe something to both fabrics�the exuberant floral setting, in which 

Aphrodite glides along with her two attendant Erotes, is, however, purely Apulian. 

There are many parallels to it on a smaller scale on the necks of volute-kraters, from 

the time of the Lycurgus Painter onwards, and on much the same scale, dominating 

the entire scene, on a few other later Apulian vases. This magnificent floral 

decoration seemingly failed to strike a responsive chord at Paestum and was not 

repeated. Of the other patterns, the swastika meander with hollow, dotted squares 

on the neck of the obverse is typically Apulian (cf. the Patera and Baltimore 

Painters), the berried ivy on the foot is more characteristic of Paestan, as is perhaps 

the laurel-wreath with central flower. 

The subject of the obverse, which is painted in added colours (white, yellow, 

orange-brown, red and purple), is popular in Apulian, where one of the best 

examples of it is to be seen in the dish in Ruvo (1613; RVAp II, p. 732, no. 23/39, pi. 

270, 1), attributed to the Patera Painter, in which it would be difficult not to see a 

possible source of inspiration for its treatment on our amphora. The tambourine 

which Aphrodite holds up in her left hand is a feature of common occurrence in 

Dionysiac scenes and we may see in it some possible connection between the cults of 

Aphrodite and Dionysos, remembering that the one was referred to as Antheia, the 

other as Antheios.

The scene on the reverse, also painted in added colours, is more banal; on the 

upper register is a woman, painted white, seated with a tambourine in one hand and 

a wreath in the other, between two nude youths, both painted in an orange-brown 

shade, the one to right with a pinkish tinge; below, an orange-brown youth bends 

forward beside a seated woman, with white flesh, draped in a purple peplos with a 

white stripe down it; she turns her head back to look at the youth, beside whom 

stands another woman, similarly draped to the first but holding a phiale and a 

thyrsus. The ground is shown by undulating white lines, with flowering plants and 

leafy sprays; purple is used for the fillets, and on the tambourine. On the neck of the 

obverse is Hermes, with petasos, caduceus and winged shoes, standing before a 

draped woman, holding an open box and seated on a pile of stones very like those on 

Paestum 26633 by Asteas (no. 152), or the Louvre Cadmus krater by Python (no. 

241). The subject is similar to that on several other vases from the Asteas-Python 

workshop (e.g. nos. 28, 76, 218, 394, 408). On the other side is a draped woman, 

holding a phiale in one hand and a fillet in the other, seated upon a very Apulian-

looking pile of rocks, with black centres surrounded by white. Her peplos, as we shall 

see, is very typical of the Aphrodite Painter, with its plain black border and vertical 

stripe down the side; the part over the breasts is left plain, there is a row of small fold-

lines between them and the girdle. She wears a stephane; her hair is bunched at the 

back and tied by a ribbon.

Some examples of such vases are given in RVAp I, pp. 429-30; a later example of particular 

interest in the hydria in Kiel (B 562 = RVAp, Supp. I, p. 157, no. 27/60b, pi. 30, 3), associated with the 

Baltimore Painter and the subject of a detailed study by K. Schauenburg in Jdl 99, 1984, pp. 127-60, 

figs. 1�4, where a number of the other floral vases are also illustrated. These elaborate floral patterns 

and their connections with the painter Pausias and fourth century mosaics are discussed in RVAp I, 

pp. 189-90 (see also Robertson, History of Greek Art, pp. 486 ff.). 

See, in particular, the article by G. Schneider-Herrmann, Trn Fluge mit zwei Eroten', in BABesch 

43, 1968, pp. 59-69, where various examples are illustrated; see also LIMC II, p. 118, 1213-5. 

Greco, PdA, p. 15; the connection between Dionysos and Aphrodite in the underworld is 

extensively discussed by H. R. W. Smith in Funerary Symbolism, see index under Aphrodite and 

Dionysos; see also LIMC II, p. 129. 

The bell-krater in Benevento from Montesarchio, T. 1310 (no. 304), attributed to Python, 

probably represents Dionysos watching the anodos of Aphrodite. 

figure, gives us perhaps a better idea of the style of the Aphrodite Painter than does 

his amphora. The shape is not a common one at Paestum and it will be noted that in 

the firing the vase developed a substantial fissure in the centre of its body. It is of 

particular interest that Asteas painted a vase of the same shape and decorated with 

the same subject (Paestum 26631; no. 151 above); it comes from Contrada Gaudo 

(1972) Tomb 2, which also contained a hydria by the Aphrodite Painter. 

The two versions of the Judgment scene differ considerably, although both include 

the same characters. On the Asteas vase we have Hermes in front of Paris in the 

centre of the picture, with Aphrodite to left, and Hera and Athena to right, some 

emphasis being placed on Hera; on no. 964 we have Hera on the extreme left, then 

Athena, holding her helmet in her hand, then Aphrodite wearing a filmy and very 

revealing garment and holding in her hand a 'xylophone', an instrument which 

indicates the painter's Apulian background. Then comes Hermes, a petasos on his 

head, and a palm-branch in his right hand, standing in front of Paris, who is seated 

upon a stool, wearing a Phrygian cap, with a piece of drapery across the lower part 

of his body and held up in his left hand, with which he also grasps a sceptre. The 

goddesses all wear elaborate drapery, especially Hera who has a peplos with a row of 

palmettes at the top, and a lower border of rays and chequers, with a dot-stripe 

border down the side, as well as on the shawl over her shoulders; it is very 

reminiscent of the drapery of Leto on no. 142, of Ismene on the Cadmus lekanis (no. 

141), especially for the wavy dot-stripe folds down the side, or of Hera on Brussels 

A 813 (no. 147), all attributed to Asteas, as well as that of Leda on Python's signed 

vase (no. 240). Athena wears a peplos down the side of which runs a black stripe with 

a white centre, a pattern much favoured by the Aphrodite Painter. Aphrodite stands 

in front of a white laver; her face, framed by long curling locks, is seen in three-

quarter view as she stands in a highly mannered pose, her drapery arranged in a 

somewhat provocative way. Hermes, in a short tunic, with a studded girdle at the 

waist, is explaining the situation to Paris with the goddesses lined up behind him 

ready for the contest. The leafy tree which grew beside Paris on the Asteas vase has 

now moved to the left and is immediately beside Hera. 

The ornamental pattern-work is unusually rich. On the neck, as well as black 

rays on a white background and a small band of egg-pattern, is a zone of diamonds 

in white and red, clearly of Apulian inspiration, and on the shoulder, rosettes and 

phialai (also Apulian) above a laurel-wreath, with leaves alternating in added white 

and red-figure and a flower in the centre. It is, however, the decoration on and 

below the handle that strikes the most unusual note. The handle itself is decorated 

with veined leaves, with a small cluster of white berries between them, close to the 

central stem; it terminates at the join to the shoulder in a frontal female head, with a 

radiate stephane, rising from a triple campanula flower. Below this is an elaborate 

arrangement of six enclosed fan-palmettes, with spiralling tendrils in the centre, 

from which spring out single, double and triple flowers, enlivened by added white for 

the edges and stamens. The decoration is not quite as elaborate as on the amphora, 

but it strikes a new note for Paestan, which we shall find again only in a much 

reduced form on nos. 972-3. 

The lebes gamikos (no. 965) is closely comparable in style to the oenochoe. The 

main scene, framed between the typical Paestan reserved bands, shows a woman, 

This happens not infrequently in Campanian but is otherwise very rare at Paestum; it suggests 

that the potter may not have realised the problems a large vase of this shape might present in firing. 

with her head in three-quarter view, seated upon a klismos; upon her thigh stands a 

small Eros, who holds a crown above her head. She is probably Aphrodite herself 

since she is in many ways not unlike the Aphrodite on the Judgment vase, though she 

is not quite so well drawn, and wears ordinary drapery, with a dot-stripe border. 

Behind her is a youth (perhaps Adonis) who rests his hands upon her shoulders; her 

left hand is raised up to touch his: both have a ring on one finger, as unusual touch. 

Behind the youth is a draped woman holding a phiale; she wears a peplos down the 

centre of which runs a black dot-stripe with a white centre; her left leg is bent at the 

knee and drawn backward. In front of the seated figure is a half-draped youth, with 

a knotty stick and a mirror, and a draped woman, leaning forward with her left arm 

resting upon a white pillar. She wears a very thin peplos, which reveals the outline of 

her right leg beneath it; the peplos has a black and white vertical dot-stripe like that 

worn by the other woman. The reverse design is simpler and shows a woman seated 

on a pile of three rocks, almost a replica of the seated woman on the neck of the 

reverse of the Aphrodite amphora, between a nude youth and a draped woman. 

The lid is very elaborate and consists of a lekanis-like lower part, above which, 

supported by a long stem, is another lekanis, on top of which, again connected by a 

stem, is a small lebes gamikos with a knobbed lid, decorated on one side with a 

female head, on the other with that of a youth. The lower lid is decorated with a 

woman wearing a black tunic, with a central white stripe and a row of white dots on 

each side of it; over the lower part of her body is a piece of drapery; in her lap are 

three large white round objects, as on that of the seated woman on the obverse; she 

holds a mirror and a spray; on the other side is a half-draped youth in a reclining 

position, with a phiale and a wreath, a piece of drapery with a dot-stripe border 

covering the lower half of his body. Below the handles are four enclosed fan-

palmettes, with side-scrolls and spirals, but without flowers; on the shoulder on both 

sides are two plastic conical knobs. 

That these three vases are the work of a single painter is hardly open to doubt 

and they enable us to recognise some of the characteristics which mark his particular 

style; this, although it owes much to the work of Asteas and Python, is none the less 

very individual. We have already noted the strong Apulian influence in the 

decorative patterns; this is also visible in the drawing of the faces, especially in three-

quarter view, which, as Greco has pointed out, find close parallels in the work of the 

Lycurgus Painter and also of the forerunners of the Darius Painter, in the first 

decade or so of the second half of the fourth century. Greco suggests (PdA, p. 43) that 

the Aphrodite Painter might have been a native Paestan who travelled to Apulia 

and was influenced by the vases he saw there; to me it seems more likely that he was a 

migrant from Apulia, taught by Asteas and Python to paint his pictures in the 

Paestan manner, since he seems to become more Paestan in his approach as time 

goes on. 

Among the more characteristic features of his drawing we may note: (i) the 

rendering of the face�in profile, the nose is long and straight; the lips fairly thick, 

with the lower one curving slightly outward; there are three parallel lines above the 

pupil of the eye for the brow and upper eyelid and a short one below for the lower 

eyelid; the pupil is comparatively small, although much larger when shown in three-

quarter view, when it may also be given a touch of added white; 

(ii) the presence of two small strokes just beside the knee on male figures, as on 

the youth bending forward on no. 965, or on those on nos. 970-2; 

(iii) the treatment of the hair�it is often long and drawn in spiralling curls, 

falling down on to the shoulders; there is a good deal of accessory jewellery� 

earrings, necklaces, bangles, and even finger rings. Also characteristic is a rather 

loose white band round the lower part of the arm or leg (as on the youth to left on no. 

972); _ 

(iv) the drawing of fold-lines on the drapery�these tend to run down the 

drapery in a series of clearly-defined lines; the area around the breasts is left plain, 

with a series of short lines running up from the waist (as on nos. 965-6); at times an 

almost transparent material is used for the drapery, which allows a clear vision of the 

body beneath; there is generally a central stripe down the drapery, plain black or 

black and white.

These characteristics will also be seen on the three smaller r.f. vases from the same 

tomb, which include two of comparatively rare shape, a guttus (no. 967), which we 

may compare with no. 787, and a ring askos close in treatment to Paestum 26635 

(no. 154) from the Gaudo tomb, like the Judgment of Paris oenochoe (no. 151).

The skyphos (20301) also finds a parallel in the skyphos from Gaudo Tomb 2 

(26632;'no. 156 above), which has similar subjects, and provides an excellent 

contrast between the different ways in which they are treated by Asteas and by the 

Aphrodite Painter, of whose typical minor style the running woman on the obverse is 

an excellent example. In the rendering of her face, her drapery and the objects in her 

hands she is closely comparable to the standing woman on the reverse of the lebes 

gamikos (no. 965), just as the youth on the other side is a modification of the one 

behind Aphrodite on its obverse. We may also note the white ground-lines, the 

sprays, the adjuncts and the jewellery, especially the loose white bracelets and 

anklets, which are repeated on the youth on the guttus (cf. with the youth on the lid 

of the lebes). The ring askos looks like a simplified version of the one by Asteas from 

Gaudo Tomb 2 (no. 154); it has a similar fan-palmette in added white, with scrolls 

and tendrils, on the front, but an ivy-trail on the reverse instead of laurel; each side is 

decorated with a fully stretched out figure between reserved bands, on one side a 

youth, on the other a woman wearing a long peplos with a central black stripe 

patterned with white dots. Both are in the painter's characteristic manner. 

With these were found a fish-plate (20298), which has already been listed as no. 

961 in Chapter IX, Section 3 above, together with a small, black dish (20297) which 

might go with it; also two small plates (20299-20300) in red glaze without 

decoration (PdA, pi. 26 a). 

Thanks to the finds in Licinella Tomb 13 we can now attribute a number of 

other vases to the Aphrodite Painter, including several of considerable importance 

and interest for their style and subject-matter.

Lebes gamikos 

*969 Paestum 21560, from C. Andriuolo (1969), T. 53. Ht. 55/35. PLATE 148c,d 
Greco, PdA, p. 45, pi. 29 (without the lid). 
Body: (a) Woman, holding 'xylophone' in her 1. hand, seated on Ionic capital between 
nude youth, holding cista, and draped woman, [b) nude youth, with drapery over 1. arm, and 
woman with phiale, both running to r. 
Lid: the lid is in four sections: (i) a lid of lekanis-like form, surmounted by (ii) another 
lekanis, with (iii) a lebes gamikos on top of it, which has (iv) a squat lekythos as a knob, (i) (a) 
head of youth to 1., [b) rosette and palmettes; (ii) rosettes and palmettes; (iii) (a) female head, 
[b) head of youth; (iv) female head. 
On the shoulder are two plastic heads on either side, originally with added white for the 
visible flesh, now worn off. 

Greco (PdA, p. 45) draws attention to the close connection between the scene on 

the reverse of no. 965 and that on the obverse of this vase, which he rightly believes 

to be an early work by the Aphrodite Painter. It comes from Tomb 53 in the 1969 

excavations in the Contrada Andriuolo and was found together with the lekanis 

21555 (no. 163 above), a couple of smaller vases from the Asteas-Python workshop 

(lebes gamikos 21557 = no. 515; skyphos 21556 = no. 800) and a hydria (21559) by 

the Caivano Painter ( = LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 148, no. 2/614a). Although the shape, 

with its elaborate lid, is typically Paestan, the figured scenes are much closer to 

Apulian and, in particular, to the work of the Varrese Painter, who flourished 

around the middle of the fourth century. The woman seated on an Ionic capital is 

very much in his manner, although the white-on-black stripe down her peplos 

associates it at once with the work of the Aphrodite Painter; she holds a 'xylophone' 

in her hand and this also is a typically Apulian instrument (cf. with no. 964). The 

drapery of the two other women is drawn in the characteristic manner of the 

Aphrodite Painter and this vase looks like one of his earliest works, before he had 

begun to paestanise, since the pictures are still unframed, unlike those on the lebes 

gamikos (no. 965), the reverse design of which seems to be a slightly modified version 

of the obverse of this one. The lid is particularly elaborate, a little more so than that 

of no. 965, since the small lebes at the top now has a squat lekythos to serve as the 

knob on its lid. The heads which decorate the various component parts of the lid find 

parallels on some of the other vases in this division, notably the lebetes gamikoi nos. 

974 and 976. 

This vase may well be the earliest of the extant vases by the Aphrodite Painter 

to be found at Paestum; it is probably to be dated not long after c. 340 B.C.; this 

would accord well with the proposed date of around 330 for his developed work, 

when the influence of Asteas and Python becomes far more apparent. 

We may pass on to other vases that can be attributed to the Aphrodite Painter. 

Most of these come from his mature period and show a considerable degree of 

paestanisation. They fall into two sub-divisions, one containing the larger and more 

elaborately decorated vases, the other his minor works.

The vases in this sub-division include several of considerable interest for bot

style and subject-matter. The neck-amphora (no. 970) is another excellent example 

of the influence of Asteas and Python on the Aphrodite Painter's work. Shape, 

decorative patterns and subject-matter are thoroughly in their manner, as a 

comparison with nos. 183-4 by Asteas or nos. 347, 349, 351 and 353 by Python will 

indicate, especially with regard to the heads in framed panels on the neck, the 

patternwork on the shoulder, and the two youths on the reverse, with dot-stripe 

borders to their himatia. The diptych above them, however, is noteworthy; it 

betrays the painter's Apulian background, since diptychs regularly appear on the 

reverses of Apulian kraters above the youths. The woman and youth on the obverse 

are more in the characteristic manner of the Aphrodite Painter, notably in regard to 

the woman's drapery, the drawing of the faces and the objects held in their hands. 

This vase is a splendid example of its painter's adoption of standard Paestan 

practice, while retaining a little of his own individuality. 

Even more interesting is the calyx-krater (no. 971), which in shape and 

ornamental decoration closely follows the models of Asteas and Python. The subject, 

Orestes at Delphi, is also one which was treated by both these painters, but here is 

given a somewhat original twist by the presence of Electra (AAHKTPA), wearing 

crown, peplos and shawl, and running off to right, as she looks back towards Orestes, 

with a somewhat despairing gesture. Behind her is a white Ionic column which 

matches the one in front of which Apollo (AFTOAAQN) is standing on the left, one 

foot resting on a slight eminence marked by a row of white dots (also used for the 

ground-lines); his head is wreathed with laurel, a piece of drapery hangs over his 

arms and behind his back, and he holds a laurel-branch with white berries in his left 

hand, his right being slightly upraised in an admonitory gesture to Orestes 

(OPEZTAZ), who strides to right, with drawn sword in his right hand and scabbard 

in the left. He has a short cloak, with a plain black border, fastened at the throat 

with a brooch, there is an infula round his head and his right wrist. Above, framed in 

two windows are the busts of two Furies, looking down upon the scene; each has a 

coiled white snake, with rearing head, in her hair, one holds another such snake in 

her right hand and a mirror in her left, the other only a spray in her right. They are 

inscribed TTOINA and TEIZIOONH; the former designation is also used on a couple of 

Apulian vases (RVAp II, nos. 16/82 and 17/75) as a substitute for the Furies.

The reverse represents a half-draped youth with a draped woman in the 

Paestan manner, but the two windows and pair of halteres above are more in the 

Apulian. 

The Turin lekythos (no. 972) is of a most unusual shape, without parallel at 

Paestum, but very reminiscent of the Apulian acorn-lekythos recently published by 

Dr. Adolf Greifenhagen. It has a similar large trumpet mouth, here decorated with 

a laurel-wreath in added white with a central flower, tall neck with tongue and ray 

ornament (cf. Paestum 20295 = no. 964 for the latter, which is also in black on 

white), and a narrow band of egg-pattern below; fan-palmettes in added white, with 

scrolls, on the shoulder, and a band of meanders with a saltire square round the vase 

below the picture. The crossed square has dots in the four intersections and is placed 

within a larger square, another indication of Apulian influence, since this is a pattern 

not normally found in Paestan. The body of the lekythos tapers upwards from a 

fairly broad base, somewhat after the fashion of an alabastron; there is no relief 

decoration, as on a true acorn lekythos, and the body is joined to the profiled foot by 

a short stem. 

The subject follows the same general pattern as that on the obverse of no. 965 

and probably represents some type of bridal scene. To left a nude youth, with a spray 

E.g. Karlsruhe B 4 and Naples 3222, see RVAp I, pp. 430-1; also Boston 03-804 = RVAp II, p. 472,

'Eichellekythen', in RA 1982/1, pp. 151-62; the lekythos in question is illustrated on pp. 152-3, 

figs. 1-4, and is associated in RVAp I, p. 172, no. 7/48 with the Painter of Ruvo 1364. 

Another lekythos of somewhat similar shape, but without the acorn pattern in relief, is Berlin F 

3334 = Greifenhagen, pp. 157-8, fig. 9; RVAp II, p. 844, no. 26/383, where it is placed in the Menzies 

Group, but incorrectly listed as an alabastron. 

in one hand and two round white objects in the other, bends forward in front of a 

woman seated on a klismos. She wears a short-sleeved chiton, with a double dot-

stripe with white centre running down it, and has a piece of drapery, embroidered 

with stars and with a chequer border, over the lower part of her body. She holds a 

'skewer of fruit' in her right hand and a mirror in her left, like the one held by Poina 

on the preceding vase. Beneath the chair is a 'xylophone', with a central vertical row 

of beads in added white. Above and behind the youth is a seated Nike holding up a 

wreath over his head, while a small Eros in added white flies towards the seated 

woman. Behind her is a maid, holding a wreath and a red fillet, and then a half-

draped youth, seated on a white tendril, holding an open parasol in his right hand. 

The drapery of the maid has the same central stripe as that of the seated woman; the 

piece of drapery across her body and over her left arm has a dot-stripe border, while 

that around the lower part of the youth's body has one of chequers. Below the 

handles, springing from spiralling scrolls above an enclosed fan-palmette and 

flanked by scroll-work, is a female head in profile to left; the flesh is painted white, 

the hair is caught up in a sphendone, leaving a large bunch exposed on top; she wears a 

beaded stephane and has a long pendant earring. 

The figures all find close parallels on the other vases, and once again we see the 

blending of Apulian elements with Paestan. The profile head below the handles 

appears again in a very similar form as the sole decoration on a squat lekythos from 

Paestum, which Greco had already associated with the Aphrodite Painter (PdA, 

p. 45, pi. 30 b), comparing it with the head of the youth (Dionysos ?) in the centre of 

the lower register of the reverse of the Aphrodite amphora (no. 963). The body of the 

vase, apart from the head in the centre, is almost completely covered with palmette-

fans and scroll-work, enlivened by numerous white dots, and a couple of flowers very 

close to the standard Asteas type. The central area is separated from the handle-zone 

by two reserved framing bands. 

The tomb (Andriuolo, 1969, T. 62) from which this vase comes contained 

several other vases, including a lekanis (21632) placed in the workshop of Asteas and 

Python (no. 624), but also connected in style with the Aphrodite Painter, a lebes 

gamikos (21629) by the Painter of Naples 1778, an oenochoe (21625) by the Painter 

of Naples 2585, and a Campanian lebes gamikos (21634) by the Danaid Painter. 

This would suggest that the squat lekythos is of fairly late date, probably in the last 

quarter of the fourth century. 

The four lebetes gamikoi (nos. 974�7) are much alike in style, especially in their 

treatment of the youths and women, who figure on all of them. The one formerly on 

the Basel market (no. 974) looks back to Paestum 21560 (no. 969); the rendering of 

the running woman on the reverse is comparable to the corresponding figure on that 

vase, albeit moving in a different direction, and the female heads on the little lebes 

on the lid are also very similar. The rendering of the drapery of the woman on the 

obverse is in the painter's typical manner, and it is treated in much the same way, 

with minor variations, on the other three, sometimes with the white-on-black central 

stripe. The S. Agata vase (no. 975) is very close to the lebes gamikos (no. 965), 

especially its reverse; it has a remarkable lid, consisting of a bell-shaped bowl, 

decorated with bands of black and red separated by rows of large white dots, and a 

conical knob on top. The shoulder, as on the previous vase, has two plastic conical 

knobs on each side. The La Trobe lebes (no. 976) is slightly less careful in its drawing 

of the figures, but otherwise entirely typical; we note again the row of white objects 

in the lap of the woman on the reverse, as on the seated woman on the neck of no. 

963, or those on nos. 972, 977, 981, 985, 992-3. The female heads on the lid should 

be compared, for the drawing of the mouth, with the head on the neck of no. 970. 

The pictures on both sides are framed between reserved bands except on S. Agata 

200 (no. 975). The shoulders on the obverses of nos. 975 and 976 have palmette and 

floral pattern in added white; on no. 977 there are white scrolls with an 'Asteas 

flower'. 

The five hydriai (nos. 978-82) are also very uniform in treatment, all depicting 

various combinations of youths and women. The pictures on the first three are 

framed between reserved bands; nos. 978-81 have female heads below the handles, 

no. 982 owls. Paestum 26605 (no. 978) is an excellent example of what may be 

regarded as the standard style of the Aphrodite Painter. The scene shows a nude 

youth, with a wisp of drapery over his knees, seated between two women, one 

bending forward in front of him, the other leaning on a white laver behind him, 

while a small Eros flies above his head holding a wreath and an alabastron. All of the 

three principal figures will be found on others of this painter's vases. The heads 

below the handles wear kekryphaloi, decorated with rows of dots, and white stephanai 

with large spikes. The upper part of their torso is visible; there is a dot-stripe border 

round the neck and the tunic has a rosette-pattern near the shoulder (cf. no. 381 by 

the Painter of Wurzburg H 5739); the pupil of the eye is large, and the mouth has a 

downward turn as on the head on the neck of no. 970. 

This hydria, according to the records at Paestum, came from Gaudo (1972) 

Tomb 2, in which was found the group of vases by Asteas discussed above on pp. 

116-18. This would provide a clear indication that the two painters were con 

temporary and probably working together, since the vases buried in the tomb are 

likely to have been acquired at the same time. 

The hydriai from the Heraion (no. 979) and on the Basel market (no. 980) 

make a more or less matching pair, with almost identical pattern-work and 

extremely similar heads below the handles, cut off at the shoulders, with dotted 

kekryphaloi, large pupils in the eyes and downturned mouths, with rather fleshy lips 

(cf. the head on no. 987). The actual faces are in fact very like those on Paestum 

26605, but they differ in other aspects. 

The hydria once on the Rome market (no. 981) is known to me only from 

photographs, but the main scene, which shows a half-draped woman, seated on a 

tendril, with three round white objects on her lap (cf. nos. 972, 976-7, 985), between 

a draped woman and a nude youth, presents us with a further series of the painter's 

stock characters and there can be no doubt that the vase is by his hand. The heads 

are similar to those on the preceding hydriai; with large white radiate stephanai. 

The last hydria (no. 982) differs from the others in having owls below the handles; 

their heads are frontal, with a sharp V-shaped beak, and eyes outlined in white, 

which gives them a staring look; the human figures are stock types, comparable to 

those on the La Trobe lebes or the hydria from the Heraion at Paestum (nos. 976 and 

979). 

The paintings from Tomb 2 have the inventory numbers 26626-9 and the other vases 26630-8, 

whereas those from Tomb 1 are numbered 26601-4 (paintings), 26607-15 (vases). From this it might 

appear that 26605 belonged to Tomb 1 rather than Tomb 2, but a study of the records would seem to 

indicate that this is not the case and that the hydria was numbered out of sequence; it is illustrated with 

other vases from T. 2 on pi. 61 of Atti XIII� CStMG 1973. 

The Geneva cup (no. 983) calls for little comment; the figures both in the tondo 

and on the exterior are again stock types, for which parallels will readily be found on 

the other vases. The tondo has an outer border of grape leaves in added white, and 

under the handles is a fan-palmette, flanked by two enclosed palmettes. 

(c) Minor vases 

Most of the vases in this sub-division are decorated with single figures adapted from 

the painter's larger compositions. We may begin with two stemless cups, comparable 

in shape and size to no. 982; in both, the centre of the tondo was originally decorated 

with a circle, surrounded by six small stamped palmettes, clearly visible on no. 984, 

less so on no. 985. The combination of red-figure with stamped decoration on cups 

and similar shapes is not uncommon at Athens, and is found also in mid-fourth 

century Apulian, but the two techniques are generally kept apart�red-figure on the 

outside, impressed patterns in the interior�and not, as here, with the former 

superposed on the latter.

The maenad in the tondo of the Geddes cup (no. 984) is comparable to the 

running woman on the reverse of no. 974, especially in the drawing of the drapery; 

the Boston cup was originally thought to be Apulian and was in RVAp II associated 

with a somewhat similar cup in Graz (Gil; no. 21/260), which belongs to the B.M. 

Centaur Group and depicts a woman seated on a rock-pile, holding out a phiale in 

her right hand. The similarity between its design and that of the Boston cup 

emphasises the close relation between the work of the Aphrodite Painter and 

contemporary Apulian, but with the fuller knowledge of the former's work now at 

our disposal, it is not difficult to see the cup as by his own hand. The rendering of the 

seated woman's drapery, especially the treatment of the foldlines in the area of the 

breasts, and of the wavy hem at the bottom of her peplos, finds close parallels on nos. 

975, 977 and 979, and the drawing of her face on nos. 974 and 976. The almost 

rectangular pebbles which form the ground-line recur on the reverse of no. 975 and 

on no. 978; the palmette on the left should be compared with those on the neck of no. 

963 or below the handles of no. 969 and on no. 972. The row of white objects (eggs ?) 

in her lap is essentially Paestan (cf. nos. 972, 976-7, 981), although the white rock on 

which she is seated is more after the Apulian manner. On this cup the tondo is 

encircled by a reserved stripe, with a laurel-wreath between it and the rim; on the 

Geddes cup there is berried ivy, of which little more than the incised stems now 

remain. 

On the combination in Attic see, in particular, A.D. Ure in JHS 56, 1936, pp. 205-15 and 64, 

1944, pp. 67-77; Sparkes and Talcott, The Athenian Agora XVI, p. 22, notes 45-6; in Apulian, N.R. 

Oakeshott, in JHS 66, 1946, pp. 125-7, where the vases listed have impressed designs in the interior, r.f. 

on the outside; two are by the Zaandam Painter [RVAp I, pp. 288-9, nos. 16 and 17), around the 

middle of the fourth century B.C. 

Of the other minor vases, the two skyphoi (nos. 992-3) go closely together, 

especially in their treatment of the half-draped seated woman; the presence of a 

female head on the reverse of no. 993 is unusual in this group; the drawing of the 

mouth, and the touch of white in the corner of the eye remind us of the head on the 

neck of no. 970 and the face is comparable to that on the head below the right handle 

of no. 979. The treatment of the kekryphalos, with its bands of white and radiating 

rows of white dots, differs from the painter's normal head-dresses; the head, however, 

on no. 987, despite the disappearance of the black line which would have indicated 

the mouth, is very close to those on the two hydriai, nos. 979 and 980. The lebes 

gamikos Paestum 1253 was placed among the minor vases of the Asteas-Python 

workshop (no. 598), but it also looks to be a minor piece by the Aphrodite Painter.

The Boston Orestes Painter, named from the Orestes amphora in Boston (no. 1004),

seems to have been a pupil of Python, whose style he closely imitates in his earlier 

work, and his vases mark the transition from what we have seen to be the standard 

Asteas-Python style to that of later Paestan, as exemplified by the work of the 

Painters of Naples 1778 and 2585. We may begin our survey of his work by looking 

at two vases which must belong to the early stage of his career. 

(i) Early Vases

Zahn (FR iii, p. 191, n. 74) thought the B.M. krater to be Campanian rather 

than Paestan, but Watzinger (op. cit., p. 372, n. 4), following Walters (B.M. Cat. iv, 

p. 75) and Pryce (CVA 2, Text to IV Ea, p. 4), rightly attributed it to the latter 

fabric, though he regarded it as a late work by Python. This is easily understandable, 

especially from a comparison between the two youths on its reverse and those on 

some of Python's later vases like the bell-kraters nos. 280-292 above; we should, 

however, note the difference in the drawing of the drapery, which is treated more 

lightly, with smaller dots on the borders, as well as in the rendering of the heads, 

which are far less heavy. The shape of the bell-krater has also undergone some 

modification; the body is taller and almost cylindrical in appearance, with very 

straight sides. This is not the standard shape of the painter's bell-kraters, which is 

better seen on nos. 1007-1011, where the body has a more pronounced convex curve 

down to the stem. 

The subject of the obverse is far different from the general run of those which 

have so far figured upon Paestan vases. It represents a boar-hunt; not apparently 

with particular reference to the story of Meleager, but just an ordinary hunting 

scene, as commonly appears on vases and tomb-paintings, although in composition 

it obviously owes a good deal to the more elaborate mythological renderings of the 

subject.

In the centre of the scene is a large boar with a dark red-brown skin, yellow 

bristles and a red tail, hoofs and ears. A small white hound is attacking it, and round 

about are grouped on various levels the hunters, three with spears, one with a large 

stone and one with a shield and a short sword, with which he is fighting the boar at 

close quarters. A remarkable fact is that the other four hunters have their eyes fixed 

not on the boar, but on something right out of the picture; one, indeed, has turned 

his back on the fight and is lunging with his spear at some unseen foe. This is not easy 

to understand, and suggests that the scene may be derived from a fresco or relief in 

which the figures were standing on the boar's left, and consequently looking in that 

direction. The landscape setting is unusual in vase-painting and calls to mind the 

similar backgrounds on hunting-scenes in tomb-paintings at Paestum, especially 

that from Tomb 7 in the Contrada Gaudo (1972).

See, in particular, D. B. Hull, Hounds and Hunting in ancient Greece (Chicago, 1964); 

K. Schauenburg, Jagddarstellungen auf gr. Vasen (Hamburg, 1969); G. Daltrop, Die Kalydonische Jagd in 

der Antike (Hamburg, 1968); J. K. Anderson, Hunting in the ancient world (Berkeley, 1985). 

The scene on B.M. F 154 is comparable to that on the large Apulian volute-krater Berlin F 3258 

(FR iii, fig. 55; RVAp II, p. 533), on which the boar is also shown in dark red-brown. 

' Cf. the relief from the inner south frieze of the heroon at Gjolbaschi-Trysa (FR iii, fig. 48; Eichler, 

Die Reliefs, pp. 19 and 57, B 1-7, pi. 8/9). 

Hunt-scenes on Paestan tomb-paintings are listed by Eileen Corrigan in Lucanian Tomb-paintings, 

pp. 283 ff.; the B.M. krater is discussed on pp. 295-6, where she suggests the source of the design might 

have been an Apulian wall-painting or textile. The best of the hunt-scenes at Paestum is that on the 

west wall of Tomb 7 in the Contrada Gaudo (1972), inv. 31685 = Corrigan, p. 674, illustrated in colour 

in // Museo di Paestum, pi. XXXI and in Mario Napoli, Paestum, fig. 101. Here the landscape with trees 

Although the influence of Asteas and Python is clearly to be seen in the pattern-

work, the drapery, the rendering of the hair, and particularly on the youths of the 

reverse, there are signs also of Apulian influence in the grouping of the figures, and 

since the two are approximately contemporary this might be the result of contact 

with the Aphrodite Painter. 

Closely associated in style with the Boar-hunt krater is a hydria in Port 

Sunlight, which shows a woman with short hair, wearing a black chiton and holding 

a fillet and a hydria with two leafy sprays inside it, standing beside a tall stele, in 

converse with a nude youth, wearing a pilos and holding a spear. The scene almost 

certainly represents the meeting of Electra and Orestes at the tomb of Agamemnon, 

a theme to which the painter will return on the Boston amphora. The dot-stripe 

border on the piece of drapery across the lower part of the woman's body 

corresponds closely with that on the himatia of the draped youths on B.M. F 154; the 

head of Orestes to that of the youth with the stone on its obverse. The influence of 

Asteas and Python is clearly visible in the treatment of the black garment, with its 

red stripe and white rosette patterns, as well as the portion emerging below the 

drapery across her body. Beneath the handles are female heads; both wear sphendonai 

with rows of white beads and drop earrings. They are perhaps closest to those by 

Python (cf. with the heads on the necks of nos. 350-1), in regard to the head-dress, 

but the contour of the face is rather different, especially the brow-nose line, and lips 

and the chin. 

With the next vase (no. 1003) we see the painter beginning to move away from 

the influence of Asteas and Python towards the style which is characteristic of his 

more developed work.

p. 142, no. 93, pi. 40, 1-2. 
(a) Youth, wearing pilos and holding fillet, beside an Ionic column on the steps in front of 
which sits a woman wearing a black chiton and holding a metal vase; to r., priestess with 
temple-key in r. hand and Palladion in 1., [b) two draped youths, with 'skewers of fruit'. 
Neck: (a) siren, [b) palmette. 

No convincing explanation of the scene on the obverse has yet been put 

forward. As Moret (loc. cit.) points out, it seems to contain elements from different 

stories�the meeting of Orestes and Electra at the tomb of Agamemnon, the priestess 

Theano handing over the Palladion to Odysseus or Diomedes, the meeting of 

Orestes and Iphigenia at the temple of the Tauric Artemis, with a priestess bringing 

the statue of Athena preparatory to their escape. None of these interpretations, 

however, fits the picture on the vase; there is no reason for the presence of the 

priestess at the meeting of Orestes and Electra; the youth to left does not look like 

Diomedes and the seated woman would have no place in the rape of the Palladion; 

in the Iphigenia in Tauris story the statue should be that of Tauric Artemis not 

Athena. The problem, therefore, must remain unsolved until the discovery of further 

evidence which may shed some light on the matter. 

The stylistic relationship with the Port Sunlight hydria is very clear; the seated 

woman finds a close parallel in Electra on that vase, in the treatment of her hair, face 

and drapery; the piece of drapery, with the fine dot-stripe border, across Electra's 

body appears again on the priestess on the Berlin vase, and here her peplos has a 

double dot-stripe running down it, which as we shall see is characteristic of the 

painter's standard style. The fold-lines on the drapery are similar to those on the 

hydria and will again be repeated on many of the later vases. We may also note a 

tendency on the part of the painter slightly to exaggerate the length of the legs, 

especially above the knee, so that they are a little out of proportion with the rest of 

the body. The draped youths on the reverse of no. 1001 are a good example; as also 

the two male figures on the obverse of no. 1004 and the two young satyrs on no. 

1005. 

On the neck of the obverse is a siren; here, in contrast to the more usual practice 

on the necks of amphorae, where the siren is half-woman, half-bird (cf. nos. 164, 240, 

347, 349, 355 by Asteas and Python, or no. 1004), only the head of the creature is 

that of a woman, the entire body is that of a bird with speckled breast and white 

stripes on the wing and tail (cf. no. 620). On the reverse are draped youths, fairly 

close to those on the reverse of B.M. F 154; they wear the same white head-bands 

with a small spike in front and their himatia are bordered with a fine dot-stripe. 

Neck-amphora (fragment)

Pentheus attacked by Agave and maenads. 
The fragment, of which I owe my knowledge to the kindness of Michael Padgett, shows 
part of Pentheus with a spear in his r. hand and a sheathed sword in his 1. He wears a white 
pilos, and has a piece of drapery over his 1. arm. To r. is Agave with a thyrsus in her 1. hand; 
she grasps the pilos of Pentheus. On either side of the two is part of a maenad. 
Down the centre of the peploi worn by Agave and the maenad to 1. is a double dot-stripe 
as on Berlin F 3025. 

From the Berlin neck-amphora it is an easy step to the painter's more developed 

style, as exemplified in the Boston amphora from which he takes his name and in a 

long series of bell-kraters and a few vases of other shapes.

egg and fillet, draped woman with mirror in r. hand, 'skewer of fruit' and fillet in 1.; above, to 
1., head and shoulders of woman, to r. head of youth. 
Neck: (a) siren with mirror and cista, [b) draped youth (A2), to 1. 

The subject of the obverse is already very familiar to us, and the busts of the

Furies in the top corners again testify to the influence of Asteas and Python; the 

connection with the Port Sunlight hydria is also clear from the treatment of Electra. 

Orestes and Pylades well illustrate the painter's handling of the nude male figure. 

Pylades has the over-long legs of the man on the Berlin amphora; Orestes has a 

stockier body, badly drawn, particularly in the region of the pelvic girdle, the 

representation of which often proves a stumbling-block to this painter. The hair and 

features receive treatment of the same sort as on the Berlin neck-amphora (no. 

1003)�Pylades has the typical tight-lipped mouth and unobtrusive nose. The 

rendering of the eye by means of a thin, vertical stroke tends to give a watchful 

appearance to the figures. Note also the mouth of the Fury to left, with the tightly 

compressed lips and the wrinkle at the end�this is another of the minor character 

istics of the painter. 

His fondness for black is seen again in the chiton worn by Electra on the 

obverse. The fold-lines are here rendered by incised lines filled with white�her hair 

is treated in the same way. All her visible flesh is painted white�a practice which 

grows more common on Paestan vases at this period owing to the spreading 

influence of Campanian fabrics, where it is used a great deal. The stele consists of a 

white Ionic column standing on a broad, single-stepped base; at the bottom of the 

column are some offerings, while Electra is bringing up a red fillet, with white dots 

down it, and a large hydria, in added white to represent a metal original. 

The reverse provides an excellent illustration of the standard draped female 

figure; she wears a peplos with an overfall�down the garment runs a double dot-

stripe, which moves ever so slightly to the left at each stage of its descent down the 

three sections of the peplos, as on nos. 1005, 1007, 1010, 1015. Here the right leg is 

bent at the knee and the foot is on tip-toe; this leg is clearly visible beneath the 

drapery, but the other is completely concealed. The woman holds a mirror in one 

hand and a 'skewer of fruit' in the other; this reappears on nos. 1005, 1007, 1010, 

1015, etc. Beside her is a half-draped youth, again with rather long legs, wearing a 

piece of drapery across the lower half of his body and over his left arm. He had the 

same rather flat-looking face as Pylades on the obverse. The two busts above are 

somewhat out of place in this context but were perhaps intended to balance those of 

the two Furies on the obverse. 

The pattern-work is similar to that on the Berlin amphora, except that the siren 

on the neck of the obverse is now half-woman half-bird and is placed in a framed 

panel; on the reverse is a draped youth of a type (A2) much favoured by this painter. 

He is framed between scrolls with a single downward fan, as are frequently found in 

later Paestan, especially on vases by the Painter of Naples 2585. 

The figures on the Boston Orestes amphora provide a good introduction to 

those represented on the many bell-kraters which may be attributed to this painter; 

these vary greatly in size, from those of large dimensions with multi-figured 

compositions to comparatively small ones with a single figure on each side. 

The bell-kraters show a very high degree of uniformity in their subject-matter; 

the obverses, with only two exceptions (nos. 1012-3) depict Dionysiac scenes, and 

the reverses draped youths of Types Al and A2. The latter are particularly 

monotonous, since the painter introduces only very minor variations into the two 

types which appear on all of his vases. The himation invariably takes the form of an 

extended V around the neck with dot-stripe border; on the youth to right there is 

sometimes a plain wavy line just beside the neck to mark the start of the border. The 

youths, especially the one to right, are often rather pot-bellied; they may hold sprays 

or 'skewers of fruit'. 

The obverses generally include one or more of the stock characters from the 

artist's repertory�the standing or seated woman wearing a peplos with a double 

A close parallel to Electra will be found on a Campanian hydria in Wurzburg (874; Langlotz, Gr. 

V. in W., pi. 250 = LCS, p. 408, no. 318; Kossatz-Deissmann, Dramen des Aischylos, pi. 14,2) of the 

Libation Group. 

dot-stripe down it, the nude male (youth or satyr), the half-draped male figure.

the later vases the faces tend to become coarser and the quality of the drawing to 

disintegrate, and with such vases as nos. 1015, 1021, 1027-8 we are on the threshold 

of the period of decadence. On most of the kraters the pictures are framed between 

the standard scrolls with fan-palmettes, and on many of them there is as well a side-

scroll with a large single leaf above it, as on the later vases by Python. 

The two kraters from Montesarchio (nos. 1012-3) are of interest as depicting 

Samnite warriors; on no. 1012 a woman, wearing a native type of head-dress offers 

one a libation; a similar scene appears on no. 1026, but, in view of the frequency with 

which such scenes are found in the tomb-paintings, it is perhaps surprising that they 

are so infrequent upon the vases. Nos. 1012 and 1026 probably look back to Python's 

krater in Richmond (81.71 = no. 285), which shows a similar scene. 

The other unusual subject is the Dionysos on a panther on no. 1019, of which a 

variant appears on the Leiden cup (no. 1029), on which the rider is a maenad. The 

two panthers are remarkably alike, but the riders face in opposite directions, 

Dionysos to right and the maenad to left.

The Garden of the Hesperides (?). 
Below the handles: female heads. 

This is the lost hydria mentioned by Brommer (Jdl 57, 1942, p. 119, III. 14; 

VD, p. 73, no. D 14) and by Gerhard (Akad. Abh. I, 65,4). The subject is not easy to 

interpret but seems to represent the Garden of the Hesperides, two of whom stand to 

left of the serpent-guarded apple-tree, beside which is a large basket of apples. To left 

is a youth wearing a Phrygian cap and holding a spear, and another Hesperid. The 

youth may be Perseus, whom later Greek writers associated with Atlas (RE II, 

2124). Perhaps we have here another conflation of different myths, as on Berlin F 

3025. 

The hydria was originally attributed to the Boston Orestes Painter by Beazley, 

and the Hesperid beside the apple-tree is thoroughly typical of his style, as is the 

rendering of the youth's face. The pile of small stones on which he rests his foot will 

also be found on nos. 1005 and 1011. The heads below the handles are closely 

comparable to those on the Port Sunlight hydria (no. 1002), though they lack the 

rows of white beads. The influence of Asteas is apparent in both the composition and 

the pattern-work (cf. with his Hesperides lekythos, no. 135 and the Orestes lekythos 

from Paestum, no. 142), but the drawing of the figures is in the characteristic 

manner of the Boston Orestes Painter and there can be little doubt that the vase is by 

his own hand. 

Two more hydriai may be attributed to the Boston Orestes Painter, one with a 

subject of some interest, the other standard.

Satyr and maenad beside a stele. 

The Ambush of Troilos is a popular subject in Greek vase-painting, but the 

scene showing Troilos watering his horse is less common. Here we see him as a young 

man, wearing an embroidered chlamys, a sheathed sword by his left side and a spear 

in his left hand, while his right holds the bridle of his horse which is drinking from a 

flat trough on the ground. As on one or two other vases by this painter (e.g. Sydney 

48.05, Brussels R 261) the feet of Troilos cut through the border below the picture. 

To left is another youth, wearing a chlamys and holding a spear and a sheathed 

sword, presumably a Greek, since legend records that Troilos was accompanied only 

by a Phrygian slave. On the other side is Achilles, with helmet and shield, in the act 

of drawing the sword with which he intends to slay Troilos. In the background is the 

outline of what might be a mound, or possibly the mouth of a cave or grotto. The 

youth,to left and Troilos are comparable to Pylades and Orestes on the Boston 

amphora (no. 1004), in the rendering of anatomy, and of their hair and features. On 

the shoulder is a stag being attacked by a panther and a lion�such representations 

are rare at Paestum, though not infrequent on Campanian and Apulian vases. 

Beneath each handle is a large sphinx, seated upon a palmette-scroll, with a dotted 

See LIMC I, s.v. Achilleus, pp. 72 ff, with bibliography on pp. 73^4. Useful lists of the 

representations will be found in: Brommer, VD, pp. 357 ff; K. Schauenburg, 'Achilleus in der 

unteritalischen Vasenmalerei', in BJbb 161, 1961, pp. 215-35, where this vase is no. 5 on p. 218. For 

representations of the watering of the horse see Cambitoglou and Wade, 'Achilles and Troilos', in AntK 

15, 1972, p. 93 (see also Le Peintre de Darius et son milieu, pp. 249-52); to these should now be added (i) an

Apulian bell-krater in Taranto [Atti 21 CStMG 1981, pi. 49, 3^1), which has certain elements in common 

with the Vienna hydria; (ii) an Apulian volute-krater in the Galerie Samarcande in Paris, near in style 

to the Painter of Copenhagen 4223. 

flower similar to the one of the Palmella hydria and the San Francisco bell-krater; it 

also probably reflects Campanian influence since it is of a type found in that fabric. 

The sphinx closely resembles the Fury on the top left of the Boston amphora, with 

the rather flat mouth and the little wrinkle. 

The remaining vases of larger dimensions come from the painter's later period 

and show the same deterioration in the quality of his work that we observed in a few 

of the bell-kraters.

The Judgment of Paris lekythos in the Louvre (no. 1025) is a good instance of 

one of the painter's less happy efforts; the faces are coarse and expressionless, the 

drawing is indifferent. The oenochoe in the same museum is of interest for its subject-

matter and finds a parallel on Benevento 601 S (no. 1012); the other two are 

uninspired. The panther on the Leiden cup finds a close parallel on the bell-krater 

no. 1019 above, and also on a couple of plates�Naples 2681 and once Geneva 

market�each depicting three such beasts, but they seem nearer in style to the 

Painter of Naples 1778 (nos. 3/73-4 below). 

(iii) Smaller vases 

A few minor vases may also be attributed to the Boston Orestes Painter and are 

decorated for the most part with single figures taken from the larger vases. The 

skyphos B.M. F 253, placed in PP in the Asteas Group, is now transferred to this 

painter, in view of its similarity in shape, decoration and style to the Turin skyphos, 

which is certainly by his hand; the dancing maenad on the obverse is, in any case, 

very much in this painter's own manner.

Lastly, we should look at a few vases, which, either because of extensive repain

because they are no longer accessible, cannot be specifically attributed to the Boston 

Orestes Painter, although they seem to belong to this general area.

The Rape of Cassandra is also a popular subject in vase-painting and the 

Vienna amphora is an outstanding example of its representation, but unfortunately 

almost the entire picture has been repainted, thus obscuring much of the original 

drawing. In the centre a white-fleshed Cassandra (inscribed below, on the base on

which she is kneeling, KE2ANAPH; some of the letters have been touched up) grasps 

the Palladion; behind her is Ajax, with flapping chlamys, sheathed sword, his pilos 

fallen behind him; he grabs her by the arm and the hair to dislodge her. To right the 

temple priestess (inscribed above in added white TPOIO h IEPEA) moves away, her 

right hand raised in a gesture of despair, her left clasping the temple key. She wears a 

long chiton, with white beads down the sleeves, and a double wave-pattern with 

central white stripe running down the centre. On the neck is a seated woman 

holding a tambourine; the reverse has two draped youths, with a female head on the 

neck. The picture on the obverse is framed between reserved bands with black 

chevron-pattern, on the reverse with plain bands. 

The connection with the Boston Orestes Painter is visible on the obverse in the 

figure of the priestess, whose right foot cuts into the border below, and whose hair, 

face and drapery are in that painter's manner. The youths on the reverse also follow 

his general pattern, but differ slightly in stance, especially the one to right, who is the 

Type A3. The dot-stripe borders, however, are like those appearing on his vases. The 

obverse also has affinities with the work of the Aphrodite Painter, especially in the 

treatment of Cassandra. On the whole the vase seems to me best placed near to the 

Boston Orestes Painter, but until it has been cleaned, it is difficult to be more precise. 

The other amphora, preserved only in Tischbein's drawing, depicts on the 

obverse the rape of Thalia, a rare myth, but thanks to the inscription above the 

nymph (0AAIA) easily interpreted. Thalia was carried off by Zeus in the form of an 

eagle, while she was playing on the slopes of Mt. Etna, and subsequently gave birth 

to the Palikoi. Behind the eagle is a large radiate nimbus, like the one on the 

Ganymede fragment (no. 243) to indicate that this is no ordinary bird, but Zeus 

himself in the guise of an eagle. 

Both Hauser and Zahn (FR iii, p. 60, n. 2; p. 186, n. 43) referred the lost vase to 

the fabric of Paestum and placed it near to the style of Asteas and Python. A 

Tischbein drawing is not always very helpful when it comes to making attributions, 

but the siren on the neck of the obverse and the rendering of Thalia's drapery suggest 

that it might also be not too far away from the Boston Orestes Painter. 

The cup Naples 2581 (inv. 82091 = PAdd, p. 13, no. A 204), representing in the 

tondo two women at a laver with Eros (Sudhoff, Aus dem antiken Badewesen, fig. 39) 

and, in the exergue, a sphinx near to that below the handle of Vienna 2949, has been 

so extensively repainted that very little of the original remains and it is possible that 

the whole of the figured scene in its present form is modern. 

Reviewing the work of the Boston Orestes Painter, one cannot fail to be struck by 

his close adherence to what may be called the Paestan tradition. He paints a large 

series of vases�mostly bell-kraters�with Dionysiac subjects upon them, and a few 

others with mythological ones in exactly the manner of Asteas and Python. He 

begins his work in Python's later period, and models his style at first on that artist's, 

but soon develops a characteristic, individual style. The outstanding elements of this 

are the expressionless face, with unaccentuated features, tightly-compressed lips and 

a watchful look due to the rendering of the pupil of the eye by a single, vertical 

stroke; the exaggerated twist of the free leg and the often disproportionate length of 

the lower half of the body; the stylised drawing of the pelvic girdle and the rather 

"On Thalia see L. Curtius, 'Thalia' in Studi Nogara (1937), pp. 105-18, which deals at length with 

the fragment of an Apulian bell-krater now in the Fogg Art Museum (1952.33) and republished in 

VMG, p. 87, no. 17, with updated bibliography. 

pinched-in waist. In his drapery he makes extensive use of black, often with pu

red adjuncts, of ornaments such as dotted circles, rosettes, etc., and of a double dot-

stripe down the centre of the chiton, the folds of which are shown by means of very 

fine lines. The draped youths of his reverses get steadily farther and farther away 

from those of Asteas or Python, the drapery becomes thinner and the borders 

smaller, while the drawing is less and less careful. With the development of his style 

an element of coarseness in the drawing of the face becomes very apparent�for 

instance, on the lekythos with the Judgment of Paris�and the hair becomes 

straggly, in anticipation of the style of the earlier vases of the period of decadence, 

which are about contemporary with his latest works. The chief importance of the 

Boston Orestes Painter lies in the fact that his work serves to bridge the gap between 

the great period of Paestan pottery, when Asteas and Python were at their best, and 

its final phase of utter decline.

The excavations of the past thirty years at Paestum have greatly increased the 

number of vases that can be attributed to, or associated with, the Painter of Naples 

1778 and they enable us to trace the development of his artistic career in far greater 

detail than was previously possible. His work reflects the influence of Python, the 

Aphrodite Painter and the Boston Orestes Painter at Paestum, but even more 

strongly that of the Laghetto-Caivano-B.M. F 63 group of Campanian. Indeed, the 

Caivano Painter was originally thought to be Paestan (PP, pp. 84�91), but later it 

seemed better to transfer him to Campanian (PPSupp, pp. 38-9; Beazley, JHS 63, 

1943, pp. 80-82; LCS, pp. 305-313, Suppl. Ill, pp. 145-9; Napoli Antica (1985), 

pp. 321-8), since rather fewer than one-third of his extant vases have an established 

Paestan provenience. Further, he makes considerable use of the bail-amphora, an 

essentially Campanian shape in red-figure and not found in Paestan; nor does he use 

the typical Paestan framing-palmettes, preferring a scroll with a bell-shaped flower 

that has a cluster of dots in the centre, from which rises a white stamen (LCS, p. 297, 

fig. 8 c; pi. 123, 1, 3 and 4). Many of his vases, especially those from Caivano and the 

surrounding area, are made from a clay which fires to a pale buff colour, and which 

is certainly not Paestan. On the other hand, several vases by him, which were found 

in Paestan tombs, are made from the typical micaceous Paestan orange-brown clay, 

and this lends support to the theory that he might actually have worked in Paestum 

for a period and thus been able to exert a direct influence on the Painter of Naples 

1778, whose style has much in common with his, as also with that of his colleagues 

the Laghetto Painter and the Painter of B.M. F63, of whose work a certain amount 

has also been found in Paestan tombs, thought not to the same extent as that of the 

Caivano Painter. A list of the vases by these three painters found at Paestum is given 

in Appendix III. 

Details of the main elements in the Caivano Painter's drawing of the human 

figure, his rendering of drapery, and of his ornamental pattern-work and decorative 

adjuncts will be found in LCS, pp. 305-7 and here it will suffice to summarise those 

which seem to have influenced the work of the Painter of Naples 1778 and to note 

those which are not found in the latter's work. On the vases of the Caivano Painter 

rocks play an important part, not so much the spotted rocks, representing agglome 

rate or breccia, as those from lava-flows, with large spherulites embedded in them;

these rarely occur on the vases of the Painter of Naples 1778, whose figures normally 

sit, or rest one foot upon, a tendril, usually in added white, in the tradition of Asteas 

'On lava-flow rocks and spherulites see LCS, p. 227, note 1. Good examples of these on vases by the 

Caivano Painter will be found on the reverses of Schwerin 719 [LCS, no. 566) and of the Dechter bell-

krater [566a), and on nos. 566b, 570, 572, 576, 580, 608a-b, 610, 611a, 619-23. Simple lava-flow 

without spherulites on nos. 567 a, 569, 571, 573, 574 a, 590, 590 a. Spotted rocks (breccia or 

agglomerate) appear on nos. 572 a, 584 c, but are more common with the Laghetto Painter. 

or Python. The nearest to rocks of the Caivano Painter's type will be seen on 

Paestum 5180, 5134 and 5146, and Madrid 11236 (nos. 166, 168, 174, 177), or on 

Paestum 4832 (no. 202), but they are there treated in a different manner, though 

probably adapted from those by the Caivano Painter. The most characteristic of the 

decorative adjuncts used by the Painter of Naples 1778 is the single palmette-leaf, 

with a central white vein, which rises from a white stem, usually with a white dot on 

each side of the join. The white often wears off, leaving just the leaf. This leaf 

(Fig. 7b) is almost the equivalent of the painter's signature and appears in the great 

majority of his figured scenes; it seems to be derived from the somewhat similar leaf 

used by the Caivano Painter (Fig. 7 a), which springs from a sort of calyx, sometimes 
ifl) (*) 

Fig. 7. Single palmette leaves by [a) the Caivano Painter, [b) the Painter of Naples 1778 

with a stem with a spiral or a drop-leaf (e.g. on nos. 577 a, 583, 584 c, 601, 633 in LCS 

and Suppl. III). Here the Painter of Naples 1778 diverges from the type used by the 

Caivano Painter, but in his use of hanging white fillets, with a small tassel at the end, 

he follows the latter's practice more or less exactly (cf. nos. 2, 6, 7, 23). As decorative 

adjuncts the Caivano Painter makes extensive use of a reserved disk with a white 

outline, probably intended to represent a phiale; something similar appears on nos. 

91-2, 128-9, 150-1, though with a ring of white dots in the centre. The Painter of 

Naples 1778 prefers large phialai, with a black disk in the centre, surrounded by a 

ring of black dots, or tambourines, which look somewhat similar, but have four white 

loops attached to them and often a ring of white dots on the central black disk, 

sometimes with a thin white ribbon at the bottom as well. Phialai occur on the vases 

of the Caivano Painter but with much smaller dots in the centre. The white ivy-leaf 

between dot-clusters, favoured by the Caivano Painter (e.g. LCS, nos. 566, 566 b, 

567, 567 a, 568, 571-2), appears on the vases of the Painter of Naples 1778 usually as 

a single leaf, but comparatively rarely. In his later phase he makes considerable use 

as a decorative adjunct of a large reserved triangle, point downwards, with a black 

right-angle in the centre, sometimes with added white and a row of white eggs along 

the top (e.g. nos. 89, 188). 

In his rendering of drapery the Painter of Naples 1778 also owes much to the 

Caivano Painter and his associates. This is particularly clear in his drawing of the 

fold-lines, but his use of a white on black central stripe is probably taken from the 

Aphrodite Painter. The draped youths on the reverses of the Caivano Painter's vases 

do not have dot-stripe borders to their himatia, those on vases by the Painter of 

Naples 1778, as on those by the Painter of B.M. F63, do. They also usually wear 

white head-bands and are separated by a typically Paestan framing palmette; on 

those by the Caivano Painter, they tend to hold white sprays, there is often a looped 

fillet above them and, where they are separated by a palmette (as on LCS, nos. 569, 

574, 574b), it will have a floral of the Caivano type. The Painter of Naples 1778's 

draped women usually wear a peplos, with or without overfall; it will have a double 

dot-stripe down it, sometimes with a white centre, or else a plain black stripe. The 

fold-lines are at first clearly indicated, but later tend to break up into small black 

strokes, especially in the area round the waist. The hair is usually caught up in a 

sphendone; occasionally a saccos is worn, after the fashion preferred by the Caivano 

Painter, but it is neither so elegantly drawn nor decorated with dot-clusters in his 

typical manner. Half-draped women also appear frequently; a piece of drapery with 

a dot-stripe border covers their lower limbs. In the later stage their breasts, though 

small, tend to be rather prominent (as on nos. 76, 85, 89, 102, 168). Black garments 

are not common; red is used for scarves or fillets less frequently than with the 

Caivano Painter; the same may also be said of added white for the exposed flesh of 

women. One area in which the influence of the Caivano Painter is particularly 

strong is in the rendering of youths with long hair; a comparison between those on 

Naples 1778 (no. 2), the Termer amphora (no. 8), Madrid 11136 (no. 16), Paestum 

21415 (no. 57), or Paestum 21539 (no. 75) by the Painter of Naples 1778 with those 

on the Dechter and Troilos kraters (LCS, Suppl. Ill, nos. 566 a and b) or the amphora 

Schwerin 704 (no. 576) by the Caivano Painter will show the striking similarity in 

the rendering of the hair, which falls down onto the shoulders in long locks, 

composed of a number of small individual strokes, one above the other. 

While it is clear that the Painter of Naples 1778 is deeply indebted to the 

Caivano Painter for a number of elements in his work, his essentially Paestan 

quality, inherited from the artists of the Asteas-Python workshop, is undeniable. Its 

absence in that of the Caivano Painter strongly supports his being placed among the 

Campanian vase-painters, who were located not so far away from Paestum that 

inter-communication would have been difficult. 

It is perhaps worth noting that vases by the Caivano Painter have been found in 

the following tombs at Paestum in conjunction with vases either by, or else closely 

connected with, the Painter ofNaples 1778: Licinella (1967), T. 20; Licinella (1968), 

T. 14; Andriuolo (1969), T. 3, T. 10, T. 54. This would argue in favour of at least 

some connection between the two painters, since the ceramic contents of most of the 

Paestan tombs is fairly homogeneous. 

The subject-matter of the vases by the Painter ofNaples 1778 can hardly be 

described as exciting. He has the distinction of painting the last two vases at Paestum 

to show phlyakes�one is Moscow 735 (no. 3), which shows two phlyax actors, 

holding shields, and escorting a draped woman. The scene has often been taken to be 

a parody of the story of Antigone, who is here depicted as being led away by two of 

Creon's men; it is a plausible interpretation, since a phlyax play on this theme is 

known to have existed, but the scene could equally well refer to other famous 

women captives, and it should be noted that the woman does not wear a mask. The 

other, Naples 1778 (no. 2), simply shows a phlyax actor, wearing a white tunic, 

standing between Dionysos and a maenad. On the later vases much of the joy seems 

to have departed from Paestan vase-painting; perhaps after the short period of 

liberation between 332 and 326, when the city passed briefly again into Greek 

hands, the burden of Lucanian occupation became heavier and there was less 

inducement to paint much beyond very stereotyped subjects. Mythological themes 

play a remarkably small role, especially by comparison with the work of the earlier 

painters, and the subjects are mostly associated with Dionysos, Eros or bridal 

preparations, with a substantial number of vases being decorated only with single 

figures. As we shall see, the quality of the drawing deteriorates appreciably in the 

painter's later phase and, in the final stage, approaches barbarisation, as is also the 

case with his colleague, the Painter ofNaples 2585. Standard framing palmettes or 

reserved bands are used, but in the later period the former appear in a simplified 

form (Fig. 3 V) consisting of a tall scroll, with one small fan-palmette radiating 

downwards from it at the top (as on nos. 90, 92; cf. also with the Painter of Naples 

2585); on smaller vases there is a tendency to omit the frame. 

Several of the tombs at Paestum contain a significant quota of vases by the 

Painter of Naples 1778, sometimes in conjunction with others from the Asteas-

Python workshop or by the Painter ofNaples 2585, who is contemporary with him 

and probably shared the same workshop. Among the more important of these tombs 

are: Contrada Arcioni (1953), T. 9 (nos. 127, 147, 152, 309); Tempa del Prete 

(1953), T. 12 (nos. 18, 25, 103, 176, 268, 298); Contrada Gaudo (1957), T. 10 (nos. 

51,67, 159, 178, 313); Contrada Spina (1963), T.4 (nos. 179, 192, 203, 211, 218); 

Contrada Licinella (1967), T. 6 and T. 7 (nos. 23, 38, 310; 14, 21, 118, 139, 217: 

each contained also one vase by the Painter ofNaples 2585); Contrada Andriuolo 

(1969), T.8 (nos. 53, 157, 260, 278, 308); T. 28 (nos. 11, 128, 155, 315); T. 89 (nos. 

17,22, 130, 164, 190, together with a lekanis (22310) by the CA Painter); and of the 

more recent excavations, Contrada Andriuolo (1982), T. 680 (nos. 99, 116, 162). 

Most of the vases by the Painter ofNaples 1778 belong to the last quarter of the 

fourth century B.C. His earliest work, when the influence of Python and the Boston 

Orestes Painter, together with that of the Caivano Painter, is at its strongest are 

probably to be dated between c. 330 and 320, and rather nearer to the latter; his 

latest may just go down to the early years of the next century, but it would seem that 

r.f. vase-painting in Paestum had come to a timely end well before the Roman 

conquest of 273. Numismatic evidence suggests that the Caivano Painter is 

probably to be placed in the third quarter of the fourth century (c. 340-20) and this 

would accord well with the proposed chronology of the Painter ofNaples 1778. 

Cf. the phlyax krater by the Rainone Painter in the former Rainone collection in S. Agata [RVAp I, 

p. 96, no. 224; IGD IV, 33). 

 With the vases by the Caivano Painter in Tomb 5 of the Padula necropolis at Caivano was found a 

small Neapolitan bronze coin, with a laureate head of Apollo on the obverse and a man-headed bull on 

the reverse, of the type current from c. 340 B.C. (Elia, NSc 1931, p. 594). Similar coins were found also in 

Tombs 7, 8 and 15, and in Tomb 16 one of Irnum with similar designs. For examples of such coins see 

Napoli antica, p. 364, nos. 110, 51-53. 

(i) Forerunner 

Lepaste 

*1 Melbourne, Graham Geddes coll. P 5:2. Ht. 19-3, diam. 27/21. PLATE 166 
Ex Basel Market, MuM, Auktion 60, 21 Sept. 1982, no. 44, ill. on pi. 21; Sonderliste U, 
p. 34, no. 54, ill. on pp. 35-6. 
The vase has the form of a lekanis, with figured decoration around the lid and a frontal 
white female head on the knob. Internally it is divided into four compartments, around a 
central well, and each compartment is fitted with a lid decorated in red-figure, with two small 
perforated holes at the top. A comparable r.f. vase is B.M. F 139 [CVA 2, IV Ea, pi. 4,11; LCS, 
p. 211, no. 64 and Suppl. Ill, p. 105, no. 105, where it is attributed to the Revel Painter), and 
another, in the Gnathia technique, is B.M. F 502 [CVA 1, IV Dc, pi. 8,15-16), although the 
former lacks a covering lid, and the latter individual lids to the four compartments. An earlier 
example of a Paestan vase divided internally into compartments, each with a figured lid, will 
be found in the remarkable hydria at present on the London market (no. 2/85; PI. 37); a 
somewhat later lepaste (no. 165), also in the Geddes collection, is divided internally into four 
compartments, like the present vase, which may well have served as its model, although there 
are no individual lids for the compartments. 
Lid: Young satyr in front of seated draped woman, young silen capering by nude woman 
(white flesh), approached from behind by a young silen, with a nude boy bending down 
behind him, standing draped woman, nude woman at laver beside which is a swan. 
Knob: Frontal female head, with face in added white, now largely worn off. 
Interior: (i) woman seated on dotted rock, veined palmette leaf to r.; (ii) nude youth 
bending forward in front of altar; (iii) as for (i) with leaf to 1.; (iv) as for (ii) though the youth 
is here not so close to the altar. 

This vase looks to be a very early work by the Painter ofNaples 1778. The 

connection with the work of the painters in the Asteas-Python Group may be seen in 

the drapery of the seated woman on the covering lid (stripe, chequer border) or of 

the standing woman with outstretched arms; also in the poses of the two youths on 

the inner lids, bending forward over a raised foot. The palmette-leaves with their 

central white vein, the two half-draped women, seated on black-spotted rocks, with 

a piece of drapery with a dot-stripe border over their legs, and with small, 

protruding breasts, associate the vase particularly with the Painter ofNaples 1778, 

as also does the use of red head-bands for some of the figures. The covering lid should 

be compared for its treatment of the figures with the lid on the lekanis formerly on 

the Basel market (no. 34 below), which gives us a slightly later version of a somewhat 

similar scene, and also has on the knob a woman's head, with the visible flesh in 

white, though here in profile and not frontal. It is a pity that the facial features of the 

head on the knob of this lepaste have completely disappeared; the use of the hair to 

serve as a sort of frame for the head is unusual. 

(ii) Standard Vases of larger dimensions 

The vases in this division well illustrate what may be termed the standard style of the 

Painter ofNaples 1778, when the influence of the Caivano Painter is clearly visible. 

Several stock types are repeated from vase to vase, notably: 

(a) the standing draped woman wearing a peplos with a vertical stripe, usually 

lightly dotted and sometimes with a white centre (as on no. 2); the fold-lines are 

clearly indicated and tend to break up into a series of small strokes around the waist; 

on the head is a kekryphalos or a saccos, with white dots; 

(b) the half-draped woman, either standing or seated, with a piece of drapery, 

usually with a dot-stripe border, across her legs (as on nos. 24�5); 

(c) the nude male figure, often with long hair falling in ringlets onto the 

shoulders, with a piece of light drapery over his arms and behind his back (as on nos. 

2 and 8); 

(d) a nude figure, usually male, bending forward over one raised leg (as on 

no. 14). 

Most of the painter's compositions, in other than mythological scenes, are built 

up from various combinations of the above figures, with slight variations on their 

poses. Almost all the pictures contain at least one of his characteristic palmette-

leaves (see Fig. 7 b), and often one or more leafy branches as well (cf. nos. 8, 14, 34, 

38,50-51). 

Bell-kraters 

The influence of the Caivano Painter is particularly clear on the draped youths on 

the reverses of these vases, who wear white head-bands; on no. 2 the border of the 

himatia is plain black, not dot-striped. The youths are invariably of Types Al and 

A2 and in the draping of their cloaks we can also see the influence of the Boston 

Orestes Painter.

Neck-amphorae 

The neck-amphorae include two with mythological subjects which, as has already 

been noted, are rare on vases by the Painter ofNaples 1778. The scene on the first 

(Naples 1779 = no. 6) has been variously interpreted, but it seems more likely to 

represent Neoptolemos and Polyxena than Orestes and Clytemnestra. The hostile 

intent of the youth is perfectly clear, and this rules out any possibility of his being 

Orestes at the meeting with Electra. The scene finds a possible parallel on the 

Polyxena hydria in Naples by the Caivano Painter, except that on the amphora the 

Ionic column which marks the grave of Achilles rises from a stepped base on which 

Polyxena is seated, instead of being bound to a post beside the column. The only 

�Inv. 145965; NSc 1931, pp. 589-90, figs. 8-9; LCS, p. 308, no. 372; Moret, Ilioupersis, pi. 28, 1;

antica, p. 322, no. 98, 1. 

extant representation of Orestes slaying Clytemnestra in Paestan, the Malibu 

amphora no. 2/418 (PL 129 a) above, shows a completely different type of compo 

sition, and the presence of the tomb monument seems to favour the suggested 

interpretation as Neoptolemos and Polyxena. The reverse youths again show a 

strong Caivano influence, but their himatia have dot-stripe borders, and they are 

flanked above by two tambourines typical of the Painter ofNaples 1778; between 

them is a large square window, which recurs on the reverse of a very fragmentary 

calyx-krater found at S. Venera in 1976. The obverse, of which comparatively little 

remains, represented an Amazonomachy; the scene is framed between reserved 

bands and what is left depicts a Greek warrior with a shield beside a prostrate 

Amazon, and behind him an Amazon on horseback, with a pelta; of the reverse all 

that remains is part of the rim with a laurel-wreath, the two large windows, and the 

tops of two heads beside them. From the surviving fragments it does not look to be by 

the Painter ofNaples 1778 himself. 

The second amphora (no. 7) came from the same site as the fragmentary calyx-

krater, and only a small portion of it has survived. The obverse represents two 

youths, wearing piloi and carrying spears and sheathed swords, beside a tomb 

monument which consists of a white Ionic column, tied with a red fillet just below 

the capital, and rising from a stepped base, on which are fillets, eggs and 

pomegranates. Only the upper and lower portions of the scene remain, but the two 

youths look like Orestes and Pylades, although there is no trace of Electra. Of the 

reverse all that remains is the lower portion of two draped youths; they were wearing 

dot-stripe bordered himatia and between them was a Paestan framing palmette. 

Beside them to left and right is a single palmette leaf with central white vein. The 

reverse leaves little doubt about the attribution of the fragments to the Painter of 

Naples 1778, although the obverse is very close in style to the Caivano Painter; the 

picture on it is framed between reserved bands. 

The Hamburg amphora reverts to the painter's more characteristic manner, 

although the head on the neck still shows the strong Caivano influence.

Alabastra 

The alabastron is a rare shape at Paestum, though common enough in Apulia, 

especially in the workshop of the Darius Painter (see RVAp II, pp. 604 ff.), and one 

wonders whether its appearance at this juncture may not have been one result of the 

migration of Apulian vase-painters to Paestum, which must have taken place around 

this time (see Chapter XIII); among their works are two alabastra (24613-4), both 

from T. 18 in the Contrada Andriuolo (1971), which included a number of vases 

associated with the Painter ofNaples 2585 (e.g. inv. 24602-9, nos. 448-9, 452, 469, 

\7\�\ below), as well as others in the Apulianising style (nos. 637, 639^0). 

The Paestum alabastron (no. 14) is a good example of the painter's compara 

tively early work; both the draped woman and the Eros bending forward are very 

typical of the painter; it will be noted that the phiale below the wings of Eros is of the 

Caivano type. The border below the picture consists of contiguous reserved squares 

with black sides and a central dot�cf. nos. 13 and 25, and no. 341 (by the Painter of 

Naples 2585). The vase was found with a number of others by the same painter (inv. 

20344-5, 20348, 20351; nos. 217, 118, 139, 21). 

The Madrid alabastron (no. 15), of which the top is missing, is similar in 

subject, but slightly later in date and more developed in style, with rather less careful 

drawing.

The woman is seated on a cista-like object, divided diagonally, like those which 
frequently appear on vases by the Caivano Painter (cf. LCS, pi. 123,5). From the same tomb 
come several other vases by the Painter ofNaples 1778 (inv. 22308-9, 22314-6; nos. 130, 164,

close to the oenochoe 21185 (no. 53), which also comes from a tomb (T. 8) in the same area

Lebetes gamikoi 

The Painter ofNaples 1778 had a taste for large lebetes gamikoi, with elaborate lids 

consisting of lekanides surmounted by a small lebes gamikos. These are all usually 

decorated with female heads of various types which will be discussed in greater detail 

in section 3 below; they definitely establish the connection between the many smaller 

vases decorated solely with a female head and the work of this painter. On most of 

the vases listed below the pictures on the obverse are framed between reserved 

bands, often with the usual triangle in the top left corner (e.g. nos. 20, 24), although 

the reverse pictures are left unframed. The shoulders are decorated with plastic 

heads and/or conical knobs.

Lekanides 

The three following lekanides (nos. 34�6) all have multiple figures right around the 

lid, as on the earlier lepaste in the Geddes collection (no. 1 above). No. 34 is an 

excellent example of the painter's standard style, with a number of his stock figures. 

Both single palmette-leaves and leafy branches spring from the ground in various 

places, and two swans in added white (now mostly worn off) enliven the scene. 

On the knob is a white-fleshed female head in profile to left; her hair is caught up in a 

red sphendone. She is the counterpart in profile to the frontal head on the earlier vase 

(no. 1).

Squat lekythoi 

These vases all provide excellent examples of the painter's stock figures; the 

white Eros on no. 38 is unusual, but will appear again on nos. 166 and 188. The 

pictures on nos. 38 and 40 are framed between reserved bands; most of the others 

have the standard palmettes.

Stemless cups 

These cups have figured scenes only in the tondo, which normally has a border of 

white laurel, ivy or vine leaves. The exterior is decorated with laurel or ivy. The 

scenes mostly represent couples embracing each other in some fashion, on nos. 58-60 

in the presence of a third person. Paestum 4983 (no. 68) and 21704 (no. 69) well 

illustrate two stages in the courting process; on the former a youth rather tentatively 

puts one arm around a half-draped woman, on the other, the latter firmly grasps a 

somewhat reluctant youth by both arms to draw him closer to her. The three-figured 

scenes on nos. 58-60 are getting near to the more developed phase of the artist's style.

These two plates look close in style to the work of this painter but the panther

should also be compared with that on the Leiden cup by the Boston Orestes Painter 

(K 1960/4. 1; no. 2/1029 above). 

(iii) Standard Vases of smaller dimensions 

The vases in this sub-division follow the same general pattern as those in (ii)

decorated with single figures, taken for the most part from the larger compositions. 

Neck-amphorae 

There are no frames to the pictures on the smaller neck-amphorae, the large fan-

palmettes below the handles serving that purpose. The necks are invariably 

decorated with fan-palmettes, often with sprung leaves; occasionally the central leaf 

has a white stripe down the upper portion. Paestum 21539 (no. 75) is an excellent 

example of a minor work by the painter; both figures on it are familiar to us from the 

larger vases and are very typical of his standard style. The obverse has a palmette-

leaf, the reverse a leafy branch, and above on either side are two tambourines, with 

large black disks in the centre decorated with a white rosette, and four loops; there 

are also white ivy leaves, with dot-clusters.

(iv) Later Vases 

The later phase of the Painter ofNaples 1778's artistic career is marked by certain 

changes in his decorative adjuncts and by a notable decline in the quality of his 

drawing, especially of the human face. Of the latter we have already had a foretaste 

on such vases as Paestum 21416 (no. 36), Vienna 103 (no. 58), Paestum 1275 (no. 

102), or Madrid 11535 (no. 132). Many of his old characteristics, however, persist� 

e.g. the single palmette leaf, the large tambourines, the fan palmettes with sprung 

leaves and a white stroke on the central leaf�and there seems little need to regard 

these vases as the work of another hand, although some do look rather like the work 

of an inferior imitator. Among new developments in the adjuncts we may note: 

(i) the presence of hollow rocks, usually in added white, with an inner circle, 

similar to the spherulites which appear on the lava-flow rocks on vases by the 

Caivano Painter�cf. Paestum 5180 (no. 166), 5134 (no. 168), 5146 (no. 174), 

Madrid 11236 (no. 177); 

(ii) the appearance of a new type of cista (Fig. 8), as on Paestum 5134 (no. 168), 

Madrid 11236 (no. 177), Paestum 4832 (no. 202), 6557 (no. 224); 

(iii) a more general use of the half framing-palmette (Fig. 3V), i.e. a single 

scroll, often outlined in white, with one fan radiating downwards, as on Paestum 

5134 (no. 168), 32015 (no. 171), Louvre K 302 (no. 173); this had already made its 

appearance on a few of the earlier vases. 

In the drawing of the face, the Geddes lekanis (no. 165), Paestum 5180 (no. 

166) and 5213 (no. 176) well illustrate the changes that have taken place. There has 

been a general coarsening�very noticeable by comparison with Naples 1778 

(no. 2)�especially in the area of the mouth, which is now more thick-lipped and 
Fig. 8. Cistae on later vases by the Painter ofNaples 1778 

often given a slight downward turn. The drapery, too, is drawn in a perfunctory 

manner, with little attention to the fold-lines; the vertical stripe persists, but more as 

a formula than a decorative element. The reverses of Paestum 4836 (no. 184), 4925 

(no. 185), and 1276 (no. 214) or of Salerno 1448 (no. 207) well exemplify the 

decline. 

The youth with his hair tied up in a bunch at the back, who has already 

appeared on nos. 34, 36, 85, and 92, becomes increasingly popular (e.g. on nos. 181, 

185, 188), and in general male figures tend to become more effeminate. With the 

exception of no. 166, the vases all represent genre scenes with women, youths and 

Eros in the usual stock poses. There is a close parallel here with the work of the 

Painter ofNaples 2585. 

The two most interesting vases, for both style and subject-matter, are nos. 

165-6. The former looks back in its composition and general treatment to the earlier 

lekanides like nos. 34�6, but a comparison with those vases will illustrate the 

deterioration that has taken place not only in the drawing but also in the way the 

figures have been softened. The bottle (no. 166) represents the gathering of apples 

from a well-stocked tree beside which are a couple of small Erotes in added white, 

perhaps inspired by the one on the Aphrodite Painter's Turin lekythos (no. 2/972), 

and repeated in much the same form on nos. 23, 38, and 188. The scene itself is 

perhaps a reminiscence of the Garden of the Hesperides, and the influence of Asteas 

and Python is still to be seen in the treatment of the drapery. The larger Eros in red-

figure on the bottle finds an almost exact counterpart on the lepaste (no. 165), and 

these two vases are very close in style.

arms, [b) nude youth with food raised on rock, holding wreath in 1. hand, phiale and fillet in r. 
Neck: (a) female head, [b) palmette. 
In PP, and PPSupp, this vase was attributed to the Painter of Naples 2585, but the 
drawing of the woman's face, the rendering of her drapery, and the head on the neck all 
suggest that it would be better placed here. The figure on the reverse is much repainted, but it 
also looks nearer to this painter than to his colleague.

well as the drawing of the woman's face, suggests it is better placed here.

contemporary style which had such a strong influence on late Paestan, especially in its use of 
added white and yellow. The lebes is very near to the apple-gatherers bottle (5180 =

(v) Fragments from Santa Venera 

Excavations at the Santa Venera sanctuary have brought to light a number of small 

figured fragments which seem to be by, or closely related to, the Painter ofNaples 

1778. These include several showing seated draped women (VS 1372, 1394, 1551 +, 

1367 +), one with a satyr bending forward (VS 1565; cf. no. 87), part of a bell-

krater with a seated youth (VS 1563), of another with a spotted panther (VS 1564), 

and of a third with the head and upper part of a woman (VS 1577; cf. no. 85). 

There are also some fragmentary bell-kraters decorated with female heads or 

heads of youths comparable to those in the next section. VS 2500�(a) female head, 

(b) head of youth, and 2527�(a) head of youth, (b) missing, are close to the Caivano 

Painter; VS2501�(a) and (b) female head, is comparable to no. 271 (cf. also with 

the heads on no. 25). 

This section lists a few vases of rather poor quality, which, while probably no

painter's own hand, are closely related in style to his work. Several of them are 

decorated only with a bird, usually a swan but less frequently a speckled bird like a 

thrush; the swan, of which the one on Dunedin E 41-1 (no. 234) is an excellent 

example, is probably copied from those on vases by the Caivano Painter or the 

Painter of B.M. F63, on which a very similar type of bird will be found (e.g. LCS, 

p. 310, no. 600; p. 320, nos. 693-4, which came from Pontecagnano). The Dunedin 

lekythos (no. 234) has the typical palmette leaf on it, and must therefore be 

associated with the painter, if it is not a very minor work of his own.

A substantial number of vases on which the sole decoration is a female, or much

frequently, a male head, may be attributed to, or associated with, the Painter of 

Naples 1778. Many of these are of very small dimensions, with little space on the 

body of the vase for anything more than the head and a palmette; in consequence, it 

is not always easy to distinguish them from their counterparts by the Painter of 

Naples 2585, though, in general, we should note that his drawing of the mouth and 

his rendering of the hair differ from those of the Painter ofNaples 1778. He also 

prefers a radiate stephane with comparatively large spikes (Spiky Stephane Group) 

to the row of beads generally used by the Painter ofNaples 1778, whose work follows 

on closely from some of the vases decorated with female heads which were placed in 

the Asteas-Python group (Chapter IX), and again it is not always easy to draw a 

hard and fast distinguishing line between them (e.g. with vases like Madrid 11261 or 

Braunschweig AT 362, nos. 2/912-3 above). We do, however, have several examples 

of female heads as subsidiary decoration�on the necks of amphorae or below the 

handles of hydriai�on vases by the Painter ofNaples 1778 and this enables us to 

draw up certain criteria for attributing to his workshop and, in many cases, to his 

own hand vases whose sole decoration is a female head. These fall broadly into two 

groups, on the first of which are heads close in style to those by the Caivano Painter 

and the Painter of B.M. F 63, and come therefore fairly early in the series, and on the 

second, heads of what may be called his standard type. 

(i) Vases with heads reflecting the influence of the Caivano Painter and the Pa

Good examples of the kind of heads which figure upon these vases will be found on 

the lid of the lebes gamikos Paestum 20351 (no. 21) and the necks of the amphorae 

Naples 1779 (no. 6) and the one of the Termer collection (no. 8). The hair is caught 

up in a saccos or a sphendone; in the latter instance, there is a small bunch of hair 

emerging at the back. The headdress is decorated with rows of black and white dots; 

there is usually a small stephane across the forehead, and a round bunch of hair over 

the visible ear. The mouth is small, usually with a slight downward turn (cf. the 

Painter of B.M. F63), and neither the lips nor the chin are given undue emphasis. 

Heads with a sphendone more simply decorated with a single row of black dots 

appear on the lids of the lebes gamikos Paestum 5200 (no. 25) and the one in San 

Antonio (no. 24). They look back to those of the plainer style from the Asteas-

Python workshop (e.g. nos. 2/863-72) from which they are not always readily 

distinguishable.

(ii) Standard 

The models for the heads on the vases in this sub-division will be found on the lid of 

the lebes gamikos in Madrid (no. 33) and below the handles of the hydria, Madrid 

11136 (no. 16) and, for the more developed style, on the lid of the lebes gamikos 

Paestum 20341 (no. 23), the knob of the Geddes lepaste (no. 165), the neck of the 

amphora Louvre K 302 (no. 173), and below the handles of the hydria Paestum 

4925 (no. 185). See Plate 187. 

The head-dress, which may be a saccos, kekryphalos or sphendone, is decorated 

with rows of black and white dots, usually of rather larger size than on the vases in 

(i); there is a thick lock of hair which falls down over the ear, and the beaded 

stephane runs down either over or beside it. This is perhaps the most readily 

distinguishing feature of the heads in this sub-division and it appears on the majority 

of them. It can be seen, for example on the heads on nos. 33 and 16, which when 

studied in detail, are more alike than might appear at first sight and the same 

characteristics appear on the heads on vases like Naples 969 (no. 270), which 

admirably illustrates the transition from the first type, Naples 1965 (no. 267), 

Paestum 31916 (no. 294) and 6028 (no. 293). On the later vases like Paestum 5210 

(no. 298) or 5324 (no. 300) the faces have become somewhat coarser and heavier (cf. 

the hydria 4925, no. 185), but the line of descent from the earlier heads is perfectly 

clear. The lower lip is now fuller, the mouth curves more definitely downwards, and 

the pupil of the eye is a stroke. Several of these vases have the typical tambourine as 

an adjunct (e.g. nos. 270, 296), as well as the fan-palmette with sprung leaves, and it 

seems to me that many of them can be regarded as minor works by the painter 

himself. Plate 188 illustrates a representative selection.

4. ASSOCIATED FISH-PLATES 

Several fish-plates have been found in tombs at Paestum together with vases by 

Painter ofNaples 1778, thus suggesting a possible stylistic relation between them. Of 

these the most notable are; 

21183 (no. 308), from C. Andriuolo (1969), T. 8, together with 21180 (no. 278), 
21181 (no. 260), 21184 (no. 157), 21185 (no. 53). 

5068 (no. 309), from C. Arcioni (1953), T. 9, together with 5063 (no. 152), 5065 
(no. 127), 5067 (no. 147). 

20336 (no. 310), from C. Licinella (1967), T. 6, together with 20338 (no. 38), 
20341 (no. 23). 

4955 (no. 313), from C. Gaudo (1957), T. 10, together with 4938 (no. 67), 4939 
(no. 51), 4941 (no. 205), 4953 (no. 159), 4954 (no. 178). 

21403 (no. 315), from C. Andriuolo (1969), T. 28, together with 21401 (no. 
155), 21402 (no. 128), 21404 (no. 11). 

In style the plates are connected with some of those in the Torpedo Group 

(GRFP, HE; where it is associated with the Caivano Painter), on which we may note 

(e.g. on nos. IIE/30-31) the octopus with 'compressed' tentacles as on Zurich 2641, 

Naples 2553, Paestum 5068, 22596, 4955); similarly the red mullet (IIE/30), the 

squid (IIE/29-30), the torpedo (IIE/21 and 23), the bream (IIE/20) all find close 

parallels on the plates listed below. We may also note that the decoration round the 

central depression, consisting of black strokes on a reserved band, also finds 

prototypes on GRFP, HE/19, 21 and 23. 

Laurel, wave and ivy appear on the overhanging rim; wave or strokes normally 

around the central depression, except on the Geddes plate (no. 314) and on the 

plates in (ii), where there is no decoration. 

(i) 

The first four plates well illustrate the connection with the Torpedo Group; on many 

of them the octopus assumes its canonical shape for this division. Other connecting 

links between the plates may be seen in the red mullet, dogfish and two-banded 

bream, which constantly recur. The dotted fish on the Fogg and Capua plates is 

thought by Palombi to be a crenilabrus pavo, but it seems more like a sparus auratus.

(ii) 

Several of the plates in this division were put together in PAdd, p. 13 and attributed 

to the Fravita Painter, who took his name from the plate in Paestum (6561) found at 

that site. The evidence of subsequent finds has shown that the general grouping 

there given is no longer acceptable and some of the plates have in consequence been 

transferred to other groups. This is in fact true of the Fravita plate, now placed in the 

Asteas-Python Group, and it is therefore better to abandon a name which has 

become misleading. 

The plates are homogeneous in treatment and invariably represent three fish, 

which are represented in a very conventional manner. Their bodies are either striped 

or dotted; there is often one single vertical stroke behind the head, from the centre of 

which a thick black line runs across the body to the tail (coris ?). There is a circle of 

dots round the eye. On many of the plates much of the added white has disappeared, 

leaving only faint traces near the eye or mouth. The Santa Monica plate, which is 

better preserved, looks to come early in the series. The treatment of the fish is similar 

to that on the last three in division (i), and the plates in this division may well 

represent a slightly later phase of the same painter's work. 

The central depression is painted black, wave or laurel appears on the 

overhanging rim and the outer border is not dotted. 

Paestum 31868 comes from a tomb, found in 1960 near Gromola (Stregara), 

which also contained a bell-krater by the Painter ofNaples 1778 (no. 91).

The Painter of Naples 2585, who takes his name from a cup in Naples (no. 420 

below), which represents one of his favourite themes�a nude youth bending 

forward to offer gifts to a seated woman�is a colleague and contemporary of the 

Painter of Naples 1778. Their styles have much in common and the striking 

resemblances in the subject-matter, pattern-work, treatment of drapery and other 

details on their vases suggest that they worked in close collaboration, thus continuing 

the tradition of the Asteas-Python workshop. The frequency with which vases by 

both painters are found together in the same tomb (e.g. Tempa del Prete, 1953, 

Tombs 8 and 12; Gaudo, 1957, Tombs 3 and 8; Andriuolo, 1971, Tomb 18 = Atti 

XT CStMG 1971, pi. Ill) gives support to this theory. One notable difference 

between them, however, is to be seen in the absence in the work of the Painter of 

Naples 2585 of the strong influence of the Caivano Painter, so manifest in that of his 

colleague; the former's style seems to descend directly from that of Asteas in the later 

phase of his activity. 

Towards the end of his career, the work of the Painter ofNaples 2585, like that 

of the Painter ofNaples 1778, is marked by a considerable deterioration in quality 

and approaches barbarisation; this is even more noticeable in that of his close 

follower, the Floral Painter, and is fully achieved in the extant vases by the Painter of 

Paestum 22870, where the human figures are little better than travesties. The main 

activity of the Painter of Naples 2585 must be in the last quarter of the fourth 

century B.C., with that of his followers perhaps going down to the early years of the 

third. 

1. THE PAINTER OF NAPLES 2585 

Thanks to the survival of a comparatively large number of his vases, we are in 

position to trace the various stages in the career of the Painter ofNaples 2585. His 

earliest work is still very close to that of Asteas and some of the vases in division (i) 

might almost have found a place alongside some of the minor works from the Asteas-

Python workshop. The neck-amphora Paestum 5184 (no. 341 below) is an excellent 

example of this early stage in the painter's development. In PAdd (no. A 119) it was, 

in fact, placed in the Asteas Group, but noted as 'leading up to the style of the 

Painter ofNaples 2585'; the figure of Dionysos on the obverse is obviously very close 

to the work of Asteas, but the woman on the reverse will be seen as much more in the 

typical manner of the Painter ofNaples 2585, with a touch, notably in the rendering 

of her drapery, of the Aphrodite Painter as well. The more exuberant use of added 

white and yellow for adjuncts in the background is also characteristic of the new 

painter and the head on the neck of the obverse shows his liking for a large radiate 

stephane�particularly manifest on the vases in the 'Spiky Stephane' Group (nos. 

487-543 below)�and also his very typical way of rendering the bunch of hair that 

falls down from the forehead past and below the ear, with its zig-zag (or serrated) 

outer edge. With the Madrid amphora (11226; no. 342), which follows closely on 

after Paestum 5184, with which it has many features in common, especially the 

draped woman on the reverse and the head on the neck of the obverse, we reach 

what may be termed the 'standard' style of the painter, and all the figures on it will 

recur on his other works. 

We may note the following as typical stock figures in the painter's repertory: 

(i) the draped woman, wearing a long peplos, usually without overfall, but 

with a girdle at the waist; it generally has a thick black stripe running down the 

centre or the side, sometimes (as on nos. 342, 355, 369, 374) with a thin white stripe 

in the middle. A dot-stripe is also used, but less frequently than with the Painter of 

Naples 1778, and rather thicker than his (cf. nos. 344, 355). The fold-lines are boldly 

drawn, with a row of short strokes at the waist. The woman may wear a stephane, 

but often there is only a simple reserved head-band (as on nos. 341-2, 348-9, 356, 

361). She may stand upright (as on no. 342), in which case one leg may be bent at 

the knee, or else she may be moving in one direction and looking back in the other; in 

this case one leg appears as almost frontal, and clearly visible beneath the drapery 

(e.g. nos. 341-2, 355, 357, 369, 375, 416-9). The legs tend to be rather long in 

relation to the rest of the body. 

(ii) the seated draped woman, enveloped in a himation, with her right hand 

projecting outwards; whether the hand is visible or not, the effect is to cause the 

himation to stick out in front of her body (e.g. on nos. 360-1, 395, 420, 431). The 

border of the cloak is usually plain, especially in the later stage, and across the top of 

the body there are usually several parallel fold-lines below it. There may be a row of 

round white objects on the lap. 

(iii) a similar figure, but only half-draped. The lower part of the body is covered 

by a short cloak, generally with a dot-stripe border. The influence of Asteas and 

Python is to be seen in the way in which in the area over the hip the fold-lines appear 

as a series of parallel strokes between the two edges of the border (e.g. nos. 329-30, 

347, 355, 383, 388); there is a row of short parallel strokes on the drapery beneath 

the thighs and sometimes on top as well (e.g. nos. 347, 388). 

(iv) the standing nude youth, with the weight resting upon one leg, and the 

body, in consequence, tilted to one side at the hip�a pose much favoured by 

Praxiteles and his school (cf. nos. 342, 344, 356). Hair tends to be shorter, and does 

not often fall on to the shoulder in ringlets (no. 341 is an exception), though it is 

sometimes done up in a bunch at the back. , 

(v) the nude youth bending forward over one foot, which is raised and rests 

upon some object; he holds offerings of various kinds in each hand, which he presents 

to a seated woman; on the larger vases they appear together, on smaller amphorae or 

bell-kraters, the youth appears on one side, the woman on the other (e.g. nos. 

346-8). This youth is one of the painter's most characteristic figures; prototypes will 

readily be found on the vases of Asteas and Python and especially on minor pieces 

like nos. 2/442, 466, 468, 470, 476). We should also note the increasing effeminacy of 

the youths. 

The Painter of Naples 2585 is perhaps less inclined to frame his pictures than 

most of the other Paestan vase-painters. When he does, he may use reserved bands 

(especially on lebetes gamikoi), the standard framing palmette, or a reduced version 

of it consisting of one tall scroll, usually outlined in white, with a single fan radiating 

downwards from the top (Fig. 3, V). The stem of the scroll is generally rather thick, 

especially at the base. A similar type was used by the Painter ofNaples 1778 (e.g. on 

nos. 168-73), but with rather less emphasis on the fan. The Painter ofNaples 2585 

favours a bell-krater with straight sides, giving a cylindrical look to the body (cf. 

B.M. F 154 by the Boston Orestes Painter), and on such vases his type of frame looks 

very effective (cf. nos. 374�8). In the later stages the fan may be replaced by a single 

drop-leaf (e.g. nos. 383-4). 

The background of his pictures is well filled with a variety of adjuncts in white 

and yellow (rosettes, flowers, ivy-leaves, small plants, etc.), as well as large phialai 

and tambourines, and the triangular ornament, with an acute angle and a dot in 

black in the centre (e.g. nos. 348, 355, 375, 383-4); this is sometimes outlined in 

white. Another ornament consists of a single scroll, looking rather like a large wave 

(e.g. nos. 361, 370, 374). 

On the necks of his smaller amphorae and on the lids of his lebetes gamikoi, the 

palmette fans usually have sprung leaves, elsewhere they are normal. He does not use 

the single palmette leaf that was the hall-mark of the Painter ofNaples 1778, though 

a somewhat similar leaf, with a white vein at the top, will be seen beside the framing 

palmettes on Nostell Priory 17, Naples 1793, Vatican U 16 and Zurich 3948 (nos. 

357, 360, 370 and 439; cf. the central leaf of the fan-palmettes on the necks of nos. 

174 and 176 by the Painter ofNaples 1778). 

Until we come to the painter's more mature stage, the subject-matter of his 

vases is confined to scenes with youths, women and Eros, or, on one occasion only, 

Dionysos (Paestum 5184, no. 341), though satyrs also appear on nos. 357, 359, 377 

and 388. Of interest is the use of black for the garments worn by the women on nos. 

392-3, on the first of which there appears to be no connection with mourning or 

death. Female heads appear on the necks of the larger amphorae, below the handles 

of the hydria no. 388 and on the lids of the lebetes gamikoi. These will be considered 

in division (v), along with the vases on which they form the sole decoration. 

(i) Forerunners and very early vases 

The vases in this division, which are all of comparatively small dimensions, mark the 

transition from the style of the minor Asteas-Python works to that of the Painter of 

Naples 2585 and most, if not all, of them must be regarded as among the earliest 

works of that artist in what we may regard as his experimental period, when he is 

feeling his way towards the creation of what are to become his stock figures, like the 

seated woman on nos. 326-330. The woman on Paestum 7178 (no. 323) well 

illustrates the change which is about to take place; the dot-stripe border at the edge 

of the 'sleeve' and down the side and along the bottom of her cloak is typical of 

Asteas-Python, the way the himation projects outwards in front of her body 

anticipates the characteristic practice of the Painter of Naples 2585. The same 

phenomenon appears also on the skyphos 21591 (no. 324). These figures and the 

seated woman on the reverse of the amphora look back to the similar figures on the 

minor vases of the Asteas-Python workshop, as on the bell-krater Salerno 1447 (no. 

2/437), or the neck-amphorae B.M. 67.5-8. 1275-6 (nos. 2/442-3), which must have 

served as their models. Note, however, on no. 323 the use of palmette-fans with 

sprung leaves, which is not in accordance with the usual practice on such vases from 

the Asteas-Python workshop. Nos. 323-4 lead on to the two lebetes gamikoi (nos. 

325-6) where the figures of the seated and standing women are drawing closer to the 

standard style of the Painter ofNaples 2585, seen even more clearly in the bell-krater 

from Pontecagnano (no. 327), where the nude youth bending forward is very clearly 

the prototype of those which will appear so frequently on the painter's vases. With 

the seated woman on no. 328 we are very close to those on many of his standard vases 

and on both nos. 329 and 330 the seated half-draped woman has her himation 

draped over the lower part of her body, with the area over the visible thigh 

decorated with a series of parallel fold-lines between the upper and lower levels of the 

dot-stripe border; such a scheme is found on many of the seated figures on vases from 

the Asteas-Python workshop, and it is very popular with the Painter ofNaples 2585 

(e.g. on nos. 347, 355, 388, 392, 397), where there is often a row of fine strokes 

continuing along the drapery below the thigh. There can be little doubt that nos. 

329 and 330 are by the painter himself, and as the others seem to lead directly up to 

them, they are probably also to be regarded as his own work (especially nos. 326-7). 

The hair of the woman on no. 328 is rendered in a manner very typical of the 

painter, with a wavy edge to the lock which runs down from the brow past the ear. 

With the lebes gamikos 21154 (no. 326) from Tomb 3 in the Contrada 

Andriuolo (1969), were found three other small vases with female heads, which are 

closely connected in style with that of the draped woman on this vase. They, together 

with a few other heads in the same style are included in this division, as they stand a 

little apart from those of his more developed period, which are discussed in division 

(iii). 

The treatment of the drapery on nos. 323-5 should also be compared with that 

on vases by the Painter of Wurzburg H5739.

The following small vases come from the same tomb as no. 326, and look to be by 

same painter; with them there was also a small lebes gamikos (inv. 21151) which has 

been placed among the minor vases in the Asteas-Python Group (no. 2/904). The 

hair is caught up in a sphendone, decorated with large black dots; there is a single 

white dot on top of the brow, and a drop-pendant ear-ring on nos. 331-2.

These two vases come from a tomb which contained several others by the 

Painter ofNaples 1778 (4831 = no. 20; 4832 = no. 202; 4833 = no. 70; 4836 = no. 

184), but the heads on nos. 337-8, which are by a single hand, look, from the 

treatment of the mouth and the hair, closer to the Painter ofNaples 2585. Compare 

also the head on the small chous 31916 (no. 294 above, PI. 188 A) with that on no. 

338, where the drawing of the mouth and lower lip, and the rendering of the hair, 

are different, despite the apparent similarity in the treatment of the brow and nose. 

Both nos. 337 and 338 have a large triangular ornament above to left.

Here again the head on this vase may be compared with that on 6028 (no. 293 above), 
associated with the Painter ofNaples 1778, to illustrate the difference between their two styles.

This vase was also found together with several vases by the Painter ofNaples 1778�5197 
(no. 268), 5199 (no. 103), 5200 (no. 25), 5210 (no. 298), 5213 (no. 176) and 5214 (no. 18), 
but like nos. 338-9 it is closer to the Painter ofNaples 2585 (cf. the head on the lid of no. 393). 

(ii) Standard Vases 

In this division are listed the painter's standard vases, ranging from one of his earliest 

major works, the neck-amphora Paestum 5184, through to vases in his more 

developed style, like Naples 2585 (no. 420) or Paestum 22270 (no. 427), and 

representing the whole range of his stock figures. On the smaller amphorae (nos. 

346 ff.) the palmette-fans on the neck normally have inward-facing leaves.

Lebetes gamikoi 

The three larger lebetes gamikoi (nos. 392-4) are of considerable interest for 

subject-matter and style. Only the first two still have their lids, one in three and the 

other in two sections. The bowl of the lebes on top of the lid of no. 393 is decorated 

with swans in added white as on nos. 2/185, 195 and 197 by Asteas. All three have 

plastic heads with white flesh rising from the shoulder on the obverse and conical 

knobs on the reverse. The picture on the obverse of no. 394 is framed between 

reserved bands, otherwise they are all unframed. The scene on the obverse of no. 

392�a loving couple, with a half-draped youth embracing a seated woman wearing 

a black tunic with a central red stripe, with Eros holding out offerings�is unusual 

for Paestan, though the woman's dress indicates the influence of Asteas and Python; 

we may note the typical fold-lines in the top right hand corner of the drapery across 

her legs. The reverse gives us the standard scene of youth bending forward with gifts 

for seated woman. The obverse of the Serodine vase (no. 393) shows us the woman 

with the black chiton standing beside a youth, and on the reverse the painter's 

typical running woman, as on nos. 357, 369, 370, 374-5, but slightly heavier, and 

with a dot-stripe down her peplos. No. 394 gives us a laver scene of the type 

frequently found on the vases by Asteas; it is enlivened by the use of red fillets and 

drapery. Most of its reverse is now missing, but it showed the usual youth bending 

forward with gifts to a seated half-draped woman.

(iii) Mature Work 

This division contains the vases from the middle and later phases of the painter's 

career and includes several elaborately decorated vases with mythological represent 

ations. A particular feature of his work at this time is the use of added white for the 

visible flesh of women (cf. with no. 366 above). 
(a) 

The vases in this sub-division are decorated with the same sort of subjects as on those 

in (ii), but the treatment is a little heavier, as may be seen from Madrid 11227 (no.

(b) Vases with mythological scenes 

The vases in this sub-division represent the best work of the Painter ofNaples 2585 in 

his mature phase. All are of large dimensions and have interesting subjects. Added 

colour is used freely, especially on the lebes gamikos no. 450, the obverse of which is 

almost completely polychrome. It is the subject of a detailed study by J-M. Moret in 

AntK 21, 1978, pp. 78 ff. as part of a wider survey of the Judgment of Paris in South 

Italian vase-painting. Tomb 18 in the Contrada Andriuolo (1971) at Paestum 

yielded a rich harvest of elaborate vases by this painter or closely related to his work; 

they are published in Atti XT CStMG 1971, p. 395, pi. Ill and are also briefly 

discussed in Arch Reps 1972-3, pp. 33-4. 

The Benevento krater (no. 447) gives the canonical version of the meeting of 

Orestes and Electra at the tomb of Agamemnon, with Electra seated, wearing a 

black chiton and holding a large hydria in her hands; she is flanked by Orestes and 

Pylades, each holding a spear and wearing a pilos which rests behind their heads. 

The figure of Electra is repeated, with variations, in the interior of the Mannheim 

cup (no. 453). The elaborate palmettes on the reverse of the Orestes krater match 

those on no. 439. 

The Danae hydria (no. 448) is one of the most remarkable of all Paestan vases. 

The form of the vase itself is most unusual; the body is almost cylindrical, and the 

vase seems to have been made in two parts, which were joined together about two-

thirds of the way down. The main picture, on which there was originally a great deal 

of added colour, much of which has now disappeared, was framed between reserved 

bands, but, most exceptionally, outside the scene itself there is a standing woman 

beneath each of the two side-handles, one of the painter's regular stock types. Above 

the scene is a row of objects on either side of the central window through which the 

shower of gold is descending; these include a 'xylophone', which suggests Apulian 

influence, through either the Aphrodite Painter or one of the Apulian artists who 

came to work in Paestum at this time (see Chapter XIII). Behind the back-handle is 

an elaborate palmette composition, again more after the fashion of those found on 

large Apulian volute-kraters; the very tall neck is decorated with a band of black 

strokes between much narrower ones of wave and alternating black and reserved 

squares (as on nos. 2/241-2 above). 

The lebes gamikos from the same tomb (inv. 24602; no. 449) gives us the best 

illustration in South Italian vase-painting of the birth of Aphrodite. The goddess, 

who is shown naked, with her body painted white, is rising slowly, perhaps from the 

ground rather than the sea, since there is no sign of waves. Beside her are two 

Eileithyiai, also white-fleshed, who hold a piece of drapery behind her; above, a 

small white Eros flies by, holding another piece of drapery in both hands. The 

picture is framed between reserved bands with a central black stripe, and flanked on 

either side by a leafy tree, which again suggests an earthly rather than a marine 

setting (cf. the bell-krater in Benevento no. 2/304, showing the anodos of a goddess, 

perhaps Aphrodite, in a somewhat similar background). The reverse is in the 

painter's typical manner, with a nude youth bending forward in front of a seated 

woman enveloped in a himation. The shoulder has plastic female heads on the 

obverse, conical knobs on the reverse; the lid is tall and is in three sections. 

The lebes gamikos no. 450 is one of the most spectacular of all Paestan 

vases, since the scene on the obverse is painted almost entirely in added colours� 

white, yellow, orange, and various shades of red and purple�only the flesh of 

Hermes and Paris being left as red-figure. The three goddesses are all white-fleshed; 

Hera wears an orange-yellow chiton with red fold-lines, a tall crown with a red veil, 

the lower part of which is wrapped across her body, and carries a sceptre; Athena has 

a long peplos in reddish-brown with a central stripe and wears a helmet, with two 

upstanding feathers, over her long curly hair; Aphrodite leans nonchalantly back on 

a small Ionic pillar, holding up a bead-wreath in her right hand; she wears a long 

chiton, with an orange shawl behind her back, and on her head is a saccos. Paris sits 

in the centre, in full Oriental costume with a red Phrygian cap, patterned trousers, 

and a spear in his left hand. Beside him his white hound looks up at Hera; to left is 

Hermes, petasos in his hand, chlamys down his back and caduceus in his left hand. 

The reverse is again banal�a nude youth, in characteristic pose, and a draped 

woman moving to right, but looking back to left, and wearing the typical long chiton 

with a black and white stripe. The plastic decoration on the shoulder has largely 

been broken off except for one conical knob on the reverse. The lid is smaller than 

that on no. 449, being in only two sections, each decorated with female heads with 

white flesh; the heads are in the painter's typical manner (see below, p. 329). 

The third lebes (no. 451) is somewhat simpler in design and shows a woman, 

wearing a long chiton, with a central dot-stripe, and a red shawl over her arms and 

behind her back, in converse with an extremely plump siren (cf. no. 384), whose face 

and breast are painted white, the rest of her body being that of a speckled bird. Of 

the reverse almost nothing remains; the lid, which is in three sections, is decorated 

with female heads, in the painter's plainer style. 

The lekanis (no. 452), which comes from the same tomb as nos. 448-9, is an 

impressive vase; the reverse is in the painter's characteristic monumental style, but 

the obverse is rather different and seems again to reflect the influence of the Apulian 

migrant painters, who often decorated large lekanides of this type (cf. nos. 641-3, 

653-4). Two Amazons in oriental costume are attacking a Greek, who has been 

forced to the ground, and raises his left hand in a gesture entreating mercy that he is 

not about to receive, judging from the attitude and look of the Amazon about to 

strike him down. On the other side is a large foot bath, between two naked women, 

one of whom kneels beside it, a mirror in her left hand; towards her flies an Eros, and 

behind him, stands a naked woman, who has just placed her drapery on top of a 

square pillar. Above, framed in a window, is the bust of a white-fleshed woman. The 

drawing is still of reasonable quality, but a decline is evident in the rendering of the 

faces. 

The Mannheim cup (no. 453) takes us back to the Benevento bell-krater (no. 

447). In the centre, in added white, is an Ionic column, rising from a base on which 

are two eggs and a pomegranate, and surmounted by a cista-like abacus with the 

same objects on top of it. To right, clasping the shaft of the column with her right 

hand, is a woman wearing a black chiton, holding a metal hydria with a spray in it, 

and with a piece of reddish-brown drapery across the lower part of her body. On the 

other side, turning his head away from the column, is a nude youth with long hair, 

wearing a white pilos; there is a piece of drapery wrapped over his left arm and in 

that hand he holds the sheath of the sword he has drawn and now holds upright in 

his right hand. Round his left thigh is a white bandage. There is a border of white 

laurel round the tondo; the exergue, which is decorated with a white palmette-fan 

between scrolls and rosettes, is divided from the picture by a band of wave-pattern 

with a row of fine dots above the waves. The scene probably represents the meeting 

of Orestes and Electra, although the bandage around the leg of Orestes is not easily 

explained; Schauenburg (RM 90, 1983, p. 345) draws attention to other examples of 

its presence�it normally indicates a wound of some kind, as with Telephos or the 

Herakleidai. This gives rise to the thought that there might be a connection between 

the scene on this vase and that on the amphora Wurzburg H 5739 (no. 2/379 above), 

which Erika Simon has interpreted as representing Makaria and two of the 

Herakleidai. The central monument is much the same on both, but the drawn sword 

in the hand of the youth on the cup and the hydria held by the woman perhaps 

favour the first interpretation. It is one of the painter's better pieces and has 

analogies in its treatment with the Port Sunlight hydria by the Boston Orestes 

Painter (no. 2/1002 above), but here the drawing, especially of the woman's face, 

and of the youth's body show it to be the work of the Painter ofNaples 2585.

(iv) Later Vases 

The vases in this division come from the latest phase in the painter's career and show 

a marked decline in the quality of the drawing. This is clearly seen in the draped 

woman, enveloped in her himation, who figures on most of the vases in it. She 

appears in two forms�in one she wears a chiton, 'with a row of beads down the 

sleeve, and over it a himation wrapped around her body, to leave only the arm 

exposed (e.g. nos. 454(A), 462, 464-5); the row of small fold-lines on the drapery over 

the leg and beneath the thigh is often clearly indicated (as on nos. 454, 460, 464), 

and this practice looks back to the beginning of the painter's career (cf. nos. 347, 

361), and even to some of the later minor vases from the Asteas-Python workshop 

like no. 2/631. In the second form the woman is completely enveloped by her 

himation, which reveals nothing of the garment beneath it, except for the row of 

beads down the sleeve (as on nos. 459-60). Added white continues to be used for the 

visible flesh (as on nos. 454 and 459), and for lavers or birds (no. 460). The drawing 

has become extremely stereotyped and the subject-matter is highly repetitive. The 

female heads on the lid of Madrid 11442 (no. 460) differ slightly from those on the 

earlier vases and mark the change to the painter's later style in this regard, as on 

Naples 185587 (no. 551).

(v) Vases decorated with heads 

A substantial number of vases on which the principal decoration is a head, of which 

those of women predominate, may be attributed to, or associated with, the Painter of 

Naples 2585. We have already looked at a few which may be regarded as the 

forerunners of his standard style (nos. 331-40) and both those and some of the earlier 

ones listed below seem to follow on more or less directly from the heads of the Heavy 

Chin Group in the Asteas-Python workshop. Various types of head, both male and 

female, appear as subsidiary decoration on vases (neck-amphorae, hydriai, lebetes 

gamikoi) attributed to the Painter of Naples 2585 and they must form the basis for 

any classification of those vases on which they appear as the main subject. The heads 

fall into three main groups, between which there is inevitably a certain measure of 

overlapping, although their distinguishing features are reasonably clear. 

Group I. The heads on the vases in this group are of a plainer style, with the 

hair normally confined by a narrow sphendone or a kekryphalos, decorated with black 

and white dots; there is a large bunch across the brow, descending to cover the ear, 

with the typical wavy edge on the lower portion, and an even larger bunch at the 

back, undulating in a scallop-like manner along the top, with a well-defined reserved 

outline. The stephane, when it appears, has far less prominent spikes than on the 

heads in Group II. The brow-nose line is long and straight; the lower lip curves 

slightly outwards, indented below, and the chin is heavy and rounded (cf. nos. 

2/835-868). The simpler style can be seen in the heads on the lids of the Bloomington 

and Birth of Aphrodite lebetes gamikoi (nos. 392 and 449); the heavier on the heads 

below the handles of the hydria no. 388. 

Group II. The 'Spiky Stephane' Group. 

The vases in this group are decorated with what may be regarded as the standard 

type of female head used by the Painter of Naples 2585. In its earlier form good 

examples will be seen on the necks of Paestum 5184 (no. 341), with a slightly heavier 

chin on Madrid 11226 (no. 342; cf. nos. 489-492); a somewhat later development 

from the latter appears on Madrid 11227 (no. 434). On these heads the hair is again 

bound up in a narrow sphendone, usually with a row of white dots behind it, and in 

front, across the forehead, is a stephane with large white spikes, radiating outward, 

often almost horizontally (as on no. 343); they conceal most of the hair above the 

forehead, but the characteristic wavy or serrated edge to the descending lock over 

and below the ear is even more strongly emphasised than in Group I. The chin is 

heavy (cf. nos. 342 and 434), the mouth comparatively small, and the eyes are shown 

with three strokes above, for the brow and upper lid, one below for the lower lid, and 

a small dot or stroke for the pupil, very much as in the preceding group. 

Group III contains a number of vases, slightly later than those in the preceding 

group and, in the treatment of the eye, which now has a large round black pupil, 

getting nearer to the heads on the lid of the lebes gamikos Madrid 11442 (no. 460). 

Thd spikes of the stephane are broader at the base than at the top, almost piriform. 

The mouth has a downward curve and the lower lip tends to project. 

Finally there are a few vases (Group IV) with heads on which the flesh is 

painted white as on the lebes gamikos no. 450, and there is a curly lock of hair beside 

the bunch on the brow. 

It should be noted that the distinction between the heads on these vases is 

typological not chronological, since the painter was free to choose whatever style of 

head he wished to use as subsidiary decoration on his larger vases, hence the heads 

on a comparatively late lebes gamikos like Paestum 24658 (no. 457) are close to 

those in Group I; some stylistic development, of course, will take place within a 

specific group.

Many of the vases in the sub-division come from Tomb 18 in the Contrada 

Andriuolo (1971), which also yielded the Danae and Birth of Aphrodite vases (nos. 

448-9). Perhaps the earliest is the cup from the 1979 excavations at Spina-Gaudo, 

which yielded a number of other vases by the Painter ofNaples 2585; the head on it 

is of unusually fine quality, and it is interesting to compare it with the similar, but 

later, version which appears on Stuttgart 4.280 (no. 539), since it shows an almost 

identical treatment of the hair on the top of the head, but the face has become much 

coarser. 

The lekanides from Tomb 18 are very uniform in their treatment of the heads, 

which should be compared with those on the amphorae nos. 475-7. There is a slight 

downward turn to the mouth; the eye has a small black stroke or dot for the pupil, 

three parallel lines above for the eyebrow and upper lid, one below for the lower. 

The base of the nostril is indicated by a dot.

The tondo has a border of white ivy, with incised stems. 

Lekanides 

The following lekanides all come from Tomb 18 in the Contrada Andriuolo (1971). 

All show a certain measure of Apulian influence; nos. 469-71 go very closely 

together, with almost identical heads upon them and seem nearer in style to the 

Painter ofNaples 2585; nos. 472^t are perhaps closer to Apulianising, but it seemed 

best to keep the entire group together.

Lid of large lebes gamikos 

486 Once Zurich Market, Bukowski, Sale Cat. 8 Dec. 1983, no. 135 (ill.). Ht. 26-3. 
This lid was offered at the same sale as the lebes gamikos by the Painter of Wurzburg 
H 5739 (no. 2/382). It consists of three sections, two lekanides with a small lebes gamikos on 
top; the former are decorated with (a) female head, [b) bird, the lebes with female heads on 
both sides. 

The Spiky Stephane Group 

Most of the vases which are decorated with female heads by the Painter of Naples

2585 fall into this group or the one immediately following, as he obviously had a 

liking for large radiate stephanai. 

(a) Early 

The two cups in this sub-division stand rather apart from the others in the Spi

Stephane Group, since the quality of the drawing is rather higher. On Paestum 5245 

(no. 487) the hair is bound up in a kekryphalos decorated with alternating rows of 

black and white dots. The bunch of hair over the ear is curly; the brow-nose line 

straight; the mouth comparatively small, with a slightly projecting lower lip and a 

powerful chin. A bead necklace loosely encircles the neck. The second cup, Paestum 

5189 (no. 488) is moving closer to the canonical 'spiky stephane' style, but is again 

better drawn than most of the others. The treatment of the face is not unlike that on 

no. 487, but the drawing is rather bolder and the large stephane creates a very 

different effect. Here the hair in front is beginning to assume its regular look on this 

painter's heads, with the wavy outer edge over the ear. The tondos of both cups are 

bordered with white laurel, with outward-curving leaves and berries. The exterior of 

no. 488 is painted black, with a band of wave-pattern on a reserved stripe at the rim 

(cf. nos. 539-40).

a sphendone decorated with a row of small black dots between two rows of larger white 

ones (cf. nos. 512 and 516); there is a spiky stephane cross the brow, and the curls 

beside the ear have the typical wavy edge. To left at the top is a large triangular

The head is probably to be associated with the work of this painter, but its condition 
makes a more positive attribution difficult. 

This section includes (i) a few figured vases and (ii) a number offish-plates which are 

connected in style with the work of the Painter ofNaples 2585.

In PP this vase was associated with the Painter of Naples 2585 and in PPSupp it was 
placed among the later minor vases of the Asteas-Python workshop; it now seems to me nearer 
to the former and the presence of certain Apulianising elements in the treatment of the 
drapery and flower tend to confirm this.

Anne Weis (loc. cit.) suggests that a possible interpretation of the scene would be 
Herakles about to free Peirithoos or Theseus from imprisonment in Hades, although she 
admits that the bearded man has none of the usual attributes of the hero. 

(ii) Fish-plates 

The plates in this sub-division, like some of the vases in division (ii) of section 1 

above, mark the transition from the style of Asteas and Python to that of the Painter 

ofNaples 2585, and are still comparatively close to those in Chapter IX, 3 (cf. with 

Madrid 11368, Paestum 20188 and 39126, Salerno 1322). The general effect, 

however, is a little coarser, and slightly less attention is paid to detail, with the result 

that the fish tend to look somewhat clumsier. Dots continue to appear on the bodies 

of the fish and, like the stripes, they go down on to the tail. We may note that 

Paestum 4959 was found together with vases of the Asteas Group (4956-7, 4961, 

= nos. 2/801, 797, 740) in a style moving towards that of the Painter of 

Naples 2585. 

The plate in Matera comes from one of two tombs found at Tricarico (near 

Matera) in 1935, the contents of which included a number of Apulian vases of the 

second half of the fourth century. It is quite exceptional for a vase of Paestan 

manufacture to be found in this area, since they are normally not exported beyond 

the local zone. 

The plates all have dotted borders, with a black central depression surrounded 

by a reserved circle. The overhanging rim is decorated with wave-pattern, usually in 

reverse. All are decorated with three fish, one of which on 7446 is a cuttle.

(*) 

Here the stylistic changes become more apparent. The use of stripes and dots on the 

bodies of the fish is somewhat extended and the torpedo, which looks back to the one 

on Paestum 22256, figures more frequently. It has well-marked black eyes, five spots 

on the body, and a very flexible-looking tail, with attached fins. 

Paestum 24673 and 24617, from Tombs 4 and 18 in the Contrada Andriuolo 

(1971), were both found in conjunction with vases by the Painter ofNaples 2585 

(24670-2; 24602-4) and seem almost certainly to be by his own hand. 

24617 is the largest and most important, and on it we may note the ring of dots 

round the eyes of some of the fish, which becomes extremely characteristic of later 

Paestan fish-plates. There is little change in the choice offish to decorate the plates, 

though on 24617 they are accompanied by a squid and a very spotted dogfish.

With the three plates in this sub-division we are approaching the final stage before 

the complete stylistic break-down. All three were found in association with vases by 

the Painter of Naples 2585; 5474 with a stemless cup and an oenochoe (5473 and 

5475 = nos. 423 and 464); 22271 with a squat lekythos (22268 = no. 440) and a 

stemless cup (22270 = no. 427); 4892 with three vases (4890-1, 4893 = nos. 454, 

491, 465) all very late and crude in style, as is the fish-plate itself. 5474 is linked to the 

Gy plate by the appearance of black and white stripes, and it in turn leads on to 

22271. 4892 is almost barbarised.

The Floral Painter was named after the floral decoration around the female head

the reverse of a large bottle (no. 586), which was found in 1954 in Tomb 5 during 

excavations in the Contrada Andriuolo, together with two other vases by the same 

artist. The name was perhaps a little premature, but the great amphora by the 

Aphrodite Painter (no. 2/963), with its splendid floral decoration, had not at the 

time come to light, and the bottle was the only then known Paestan vase to be 

decorated with such an elaborate floral pattern. Another group of his vases, all 

depicting female heads, had been found in Tomb 16 in the 1953 excavations in the 

Tempa del Prete, but it was not until the other vases turned up that it was possible to 

recognise in them the work of the Floral Painter; previous to that date only one vase 

by his hand, Paestum 1237, from excavations in the 1930's in the Spinazzo 

necropolis, was known, and, as it stood somewhat apart from all the other Paestan 

vases, it was not thought of as belonging to that fabric. 

The Floral Painter is one of the last of the Paestan r.f. artists; he follows on from 

the Painter ofNaples 2585, whose influence is apparent in his work, but he also owes 

a great deal to the artists of the Apulianising Group (see Chapter XIII) who were 

active in Paestum in the last third of the fourth century. We see the influence of the 

Painter of Naples 2585 in the Floral Painter's use of added white for the flesh of PLATE 217 c PLATE 217/ 

women and of triangular filling ornaments; also in his framing of the pictures and in 

his rendering of palmettes, which also owe something to contemporary Campanian, 

especially in the flowers which accompany the scrolls. Apulian influence is apparent 

in the floral around the head on no. 586 and in certain elements of the pattern-work 

(e.g. the bead and reel on the knob of no. 584, and perhaps also on the klismoi which 

have a very Apulian look). Red is used sparingly, for example, on the folded drapery 

beside the laver on no. 586. Fold-lines and anatomical markings are done in diluted 

glaze; typical of his work is the double row of small fold-lines at the waist, done in a 

far clumsier fashion than by the Painters ofNaples 1778 and 2585. His faces are 

badly drawn and very expressionless; again the influence of the Painter of Naples 

2585 is very clear on the head on Paestum 5251 (no. 590). The decoration on his 

vases tends to be rather exuberant, as may be seen from the bottle (no. 586), and 

there is a good deal of filling ornament (cf. no. 587). 

The subject of the lekanis 5422 (no. 584) is of interest, as representing one of the 

last mythological scenes to decorate a Paestan vase, even if the choice of Orestes and 

Electra as the subject does not betray a high level of originality; again it should be 

compared with the same subject as treated by the Painter of Naples 2585 on 

Benevento 28189 (no. 447), since this will enable us to see the decline that has taken 

place between the two. The seated woman behind Orestes is a figure very popular 

with this painter and is repreated on several other vases (e.g. nos. 588-9). 

It is all too clear that with these vases we are on the threshold of barbarism and 

the work of the Floral Painter's followers plunges us right into it.

The female heads which decorated the lid of 5423 reappear on some smaller 

vases, which must also be attributed to the hand of the Floral Painter. The hair is 

generally caught up in a saccos, decorated with black lines and rows of dots, with a 

white loop on top. There is a white stephane with large rays, reminiscent of the spiky 

stephanai of the Painter of Naples 2585, as also are the triangular ornaments on 

either side of the heads on 5246 and 5251.

This section contains a few vases which are among the last of Paestan red-figur

following on from the Painter of Naples 2585 and the Floral Painter. The style is 

rapidly approaching barbarisation, which it achieves in full measure in such vases as 

Paestum 22870-2, where the figures have reached a stage at which they are scarcely 

human. The Madrid squat lekythos (no. 594) is still reasonably close to the Painter 

ofNaples 2585, but the drawing of the woman's face, somewhat reminiscent of faces 

by the Atella Painter in late Campanian of about the same period, shows the 

beginnings of the break-up. The treatment of the leg beneath her drapery is very 

much in the manner of the Painter of Naples 2585, so is the run of short parallel 

strokes between the fold-lines; it is possible that the vase is a very late work by the 

The lebes gamikos (no. 595) is a most unusual and remarkable vase, with the 

decoration going all round the body. The scene with two white-fleshed women at the 

laver is probably inspired by the Painter ofNaples 2585, as also the woman looking 

down from the window (cf. 24604 = no. 452), and perhaps even the embracing 

couple, but the curious little Pan, with his lagobolon, sitting on a rock-pile and 

playing the syrinx, strikes an unfamiliar note. The head on the lid owes something to 

those by the Floral Painter, as also does the drawing of the faces. 

This vase leads us on to the three found in the 1969 excavations in the Contrada 

Licinella (22870-2 = nos. 596-8); they are the work of a single painter, again 

strongly under the influence of the Painter ofNaples 2585, in his later period, and 

the Floral Painter. Here, however, the break-down has taken place; it is only too 

clear in the drapery of the two women on the lid of the lekanis, the fold-lines of which 

well illustrate the influence referred to; even more so in the figures on the lebes (no. 

597), with almost complete disintegration being achieved on no. 598, especially in 

the mime dancer on the obverse. There was little further for red-figure to go and, as 

also with Campanian, it comes to an unlamented end in almost total barbarisation.

5. LATE MINOR VASES 

This section lists a few late minor vases, mostly in rather fragmentary state, an

decorated with nondescript figured subjects or female heads, which make a more 

precise classification difficult. One can say little more of them than that they are late 

Paestan and are broadly associated with the painters discussed in this chapter.

The Apulianising Group was first identified and discussed in PP-s, pp. 163-7, wh

it was pointed out that the excavations in the Sanctuary of Hera had brought to light 

a number of vases, mainly bottles, in an Apulianising style which until then had 

found a close parallel only on the bell-krater in Philadelphia (L. 29.46; no. 628 

below, PI. 224 a, b). The new vases, which, from their shape, subject-matter and 

find-spot, seemed almost certainly to have been votive offerings to Hera, were mostly 

of fairly late date, were made from a deep orange-brown clay, with a strong mica 

content, and therefore probably of Paestan origin, and showed a very definite 

Apulian influence, especially in the treatment of the drapery and in the pattern-

work. Subsequently a number of other vases, of rather larger dimensions and in a 

greater variety of shapes, came to light, notably from T. 18 in the Contrada 

Andriuolo (1971), which also yielded several vases by the Painter ofNaples 2585 (see 

above, p. 316; Atti XI� CStMG 1971, pi. 111, 1), T. 76 and T. 86 at Spinazzo (1972; 

ArchReps 1972-3, p. 35), and from excavations at S. Venera in 1976 and Albanella in 

1979. There is, in consequence, at present a quite substantial group of vases in the 

Apulianising style and it is possible to recognise several distinct hands. Much of the 

latest material, which comes from the excavations in the Agora (see Poseidonia� 

Paestum II, pp. 97 ff., figs. 73-5), is extremely fragmentary but shows that there must 

have been a fairly extensive production of vases in this style in the last decades of the 

fourth century B.C. The general uniformity in subject-matter, style and treatment 

between the larger vases which have survived more or less intact and the great mass 

of fragments suggests that they were all products of a single workshop and thus it is 

possible that at this late period there were two workshops at Paestum, that of the 

Painters ofNaples 1778 and 2585 which, as we have seen, continued the tradition of 

the Asteas-Python workshop, and that of the Apulianising painters, who also 

exercised a considerable influence upon the native Paestans. 

It is now clear that the Apulianising phase in Campanian, which has long been 

recognised in the work of the Ivy-leaf and APZ Painters (see LCS, pp. 495 ff.), had its 

counterpart at Paestum, where it began somewhat earlier than had originally been 

thought, since the Aphrodite Painter (see Chapter X), who was in all probability 

himself a migrant from Apulia, brought to Paestum a number of Apulian elements, 

like the elaborate floral pattern-work on his name vase, as well as certain adjuncts, 

such as the 'xylophone'; however, under the influence of the local vase-painters he 

paestanised to a very considerable degree, both in his use of frames for his pictures 

and in his drapery patterns, as also in his choice of popular local shapes like the neck-

amphora or the lebes gamikos with a multiple lid. The paestanising element is less 

perceptible in the later Apulianising artists, perhaps because they may have had 

their own workshop and would thus have been in less close contact with the local 

artists than the Aphrodite Painter had been, but it is there all the same. The 

Philadelphia krater (no. 628) is the only extant vase in this group on which Paestan 

women is more typical of Paestan than Apulian; the white dots on palmette-leaves 

are found extensively on Apulian vases by followers of the Baltimore Painter (e.g. 

Painter of Berlin F 3383), but the white line down the middle of the central leaf in a 

palmette-fan is more characteristic of the Painters ofNaples 1778 and 2585. On 

larger vases there is a good deal of added red, often of a much brighter shade than 

one would expect to find in Apulian, and the choice of such shapes as the neck-

amphora or the bottle is more in accord with Paestan practice; the female heads on 

the vases, however, remain more faithful to their Apulian models. 

What prompted the migration of vase-painters in the third quarter of the fourth 

century from Apulia to Campania and Paestum is still open to question. During the 

thirties the Tarentines made a treaty with the Neapolitans (see Frederiksen, 

Campania, p. 208) and this, together with the somewhat disturbed conditions in 

Apulia following the defeat and death of Archidamos III at the battle of Manduria 

in 338 B.C., may have been a factor in encouraging such a move. The Campanian 

vases seem to reflect the influence of the followers of the Varrese Painter, the artists of 

the Chevron Group (especially in such bell-kraters as LCS, p. 498, nos. 414�8; on 

which also that of the Lucera Painter, RVAp II, pp. 577-9, is apparent; see LCS Suppl. 

Ill, p. 235), and the Darius and Underworld Painters, while those at Paestum, 

especially in the Spinazzo Group, are closer to the more flamboyant works of the 

Baltimore Painter and his school. Indeed it is worth noting that in RVAp II (p. 824, 

no. 26/60, pi. 308, 3-4) the lekanis, then in Preston and now in Port Sunlight (no. 

641 below), was placed in the Group of the Trieste Askoi, which consists of vases 

associated with the work of the Patera and Ganymede Painters; it is now seen to be 

by the same hand as Paestum 27027-9, 27091-2 from Tombs 76 and 86 in the 

Spinazzo necropolis (1972) and must therefore be transferred to the Spinazzo 

Group, but it well illustrates the very Apulian aspect of such a vase when seen in 

isolation; this is also the case with some of the female heads which appear on other 

vases in the same group. 

Most of the larger vases in this group may be placed in the last quarter of the 

fourth century, around c. 320-310B.C; some of the later ones, when the quality of 

the drawing is showing signs of the same deterioration we noticed in the work of the 

Floral Painter and the Painter of Paestum 22870 (see above pp. 333-7), probably go 

down into the early years of the third century. 

1. EARLY APULIANISING 

The vases in this section come fairly early in the Apulianising series and are 

distant in time from some of the vases by the Aphrodite Painter. 

We may begin with the following: 

Cup 

*621 Paestum 5678, from C. Andriuolo (1955), T. 21. Ht. 8, int. diam. 26 PLATE 221 a 
PAdd, no. A 371. 
Nude youth with drapery round r. arm and tambourine in 1. hand, standing draped 
woman with cista in upraised r. hand and fillet in 1. 

The cup was found with an oenochoe (5680; no. 254 above) decorated with a 

female head in the manner of the Painter ofNaples 1778, and in style it comes very 

close to the lebes gamikos Paestum 21560, which has been attributed to the 

Aphrodite Painter. This would suggest a date soon after 330 and this finds some 

measure of confirmation in the close parallels between the draped woman and those 

on the minor vases associated with the workshop of the Darius Painter (e.g. Lecce 

697 = RVAp II, no. 21/147; Liverpool M 10882 = op. cit., no. 21/291). 

A similar female figure, in a slightly more animated pose, comparable also to 

those on many of the minor Darian vases, will be seen in the woman to right on the 

following: 

Squat lekythos 

*622 Paestum 5656, from C. Andriuolo (1955), T. 18. Ht. 39. PLATE221 b-d 
PAdd, no. A 364. 
Eros seated on laver between standing draped woman holding cista and woman with 
wreath moving to r. and looking 1. 
Stele to 1., flower beside the laver. 

This vase was found with a fish-plate (no. 707 below), which looks also to be in 

the Apulianising style, and a small, very badly broken skyphos (5658; no. 2/799 

above) which seems a late minor work of the Asteas-Python Group. The subject� 

Eros on a laver between two women�is popular in both Apulian and Paestan, 

perhaps more so in the latter fabric, but the treatment here is strongly Apulian, 

especially in the faces and drapery of the two women. We should also note the 

flowering plant beside the laver, as these appear with great frequency on the minor 

Darian vases, which seem to have provided the models for this and the preceding 

vase. 

In similar style is the following: 

Bottle 

*623 Paestum 5368, from C. Andriuolo (1954), T. 1. Ht. 25-5. PLATE 221 e,f 
PAdd, no. A 347. 
Draped woman seated to 1. on rock-pile, holding mirror in r. hand and turning head to r. 
to look at nude youth with bunch of grapes in r. hand, drapery round 1. arm. 

We may note the rock-pile and the bunch of grapes, held by the youth, as 

characteristically Apulian; the white outline to the palmette-scrolls on either side of 

the picture and the touches of white on the tips of some of the palmette leaves, 

together with the white stripe down the woman's chiton, associate the vase more 

with Paestan and we can see here an attempt to bring the two styles together. 

Another bottle is of much higher quality in the drawing and of greater interest 

in the subject-matter. It comes from the Sanctuary of Hera and is, unfortunately, in 

very poor condition, since the whole of the upper portion is lost, and two very large 

pieces are missing from the figured scene. 

Bottle 

*624 Paestum, from the Heraion, Loc. IV. Ht. (as preserved) 33. PLATE 222 a, A 
PAdd, no. A 331; Schauenburg, RM 65, 1958, p. 51, no. 6, pi. 35. 
To 1. are three fragmentary female figures (Muses ?), then Apollo, wearing a long, 
elaborately-patterned robe with white sleeves, and holding a knife in his 1. hand. In front of 
him on the ground is a cithara in added white. Marsyas is shown bound to a tree, from one of 
the branches of which hangs his flute-case; beside the base of the tree is a box, which probably 
served as a container for Apollo's knife. In front of Marsyas a shaggy silen bends forward; 
behind him is seated woman, and above, a figure of Nike, holding a wreath, and the upper 
part of a draped woman. 

This is one of the best of the early Apulianising vases; the drawing of both the

faces and the drapery seems to reflect the influence of the Darian school cf. with 

RVAp II, nos. 18/41, 41 a, 42, 64-6). The fired clay is of a much paler shade, almost 

buff, than on the other vases in this section. 

Skyphoid pyxis (lid missing) 

*625 Paestum 26796, from Spinazzo (1972), T. 28. Ht. 26. PLATE222c,a' 
(a) Nude youth by laver offering open box to draped woman seated on rock-pile, 
standing draped woman; above�Eros with fillet flying to 1., [b) Eros, with fan in r. hand and 
wreath in 1., moving to 1. Flowers on the ground. 

This is the first of a number of skyphoid pyxides which appear in the 

Apulianising phase of Paestan. The skyphoid pyxis is, as Beazley pointed out (JHS 

63, 1943, p. 104), a shape of some importance in South Italian vase-painting. It 

consists of a lower portion, or bowl, very similar to a skyphos in form, with a handle 

on each side, and a groove round the inside of the rim into which the lid is fitted. The 

lid is not unlike that of a lekanis, but deeper and more dome-shaped, and is supplied 

with a knob to serve as a handle. Sometimes both lid and bowl are marked with a 

letter of the Greek alphabet to indicate that they belong together, and there are often 

one or two incised strokes on the lid and the body just above one of the side handles 

to indicate the correct placing of the lid. This shape should be distinguished from 

that of the round or globular pyxis, which does not have handles, and has a bowl 

which curves deeply inwards and a corresponding lid, but inverted. The skyphoid 

pyxis occurs most frequently in Sicilian, where it appears at a comparatively early 

date (cf. nos. 1/55, 56 and 58 above), and continues in use throughout the life of the 

fabric, being particularly popular at Lipari towards the end of the fourth century. It 

is extremely rare in Apulian; there are a couple of examples in the Jatta collection in 

Ruvo (inv. 1217 and 1262), the former of which is a minor vase by the Zaandam 

Painter (RVAp I, p. 1056, no. 11/15a), the latter somewhat similar in style, but not 

yet specifically attributed; there is also a very late, and heavily overpainted vase in 

Madrid (inv. 11385 + 11333 = RVAp II, p. 1027, no. 30/55, pi. 398, 2), which has 

been associated with the Fogg Group in the latest phase of Apulian red-figure, but 

which could possibly even find a place here, since in its present state it is difficult to 

be certain, though its pattern-work seems more in keeping with its present 

classification. Although this shape is found several times in the Apulianising Group it 

is difficult to see it as having been introduced by the migrant artists, since it hardly 

appears in Apulia at that time, when it is the globular pyxis that is more commonly 

found, especially in the White Saccos and Kantharos Groups. Naples 856 and 

Boulogne 140 (LCS, p. 497, nos. 412-3, pi. 192) are examples of Apulianising 

Campanian in this shape and they are not very far away from two early vases of this 

shape by the Lipari Painter (Naples 754 and 794 = LCS, p. 655, nos. 447-8), so it is 

possible that the inspiration for this shape goes back once again to Sicily. 

Good examples of Sicilian skyphoid-pyxides may be seen in the following: Lentini-Manfria 

Group�LCS, pp. 597-8, nos. 82-5; pp. 612-3, nos. 189-90; Suppl. Ill, p. 273, nos. 83 a, 84a; 

Monumental Group�Suppl. p. 274, no. 46 b, p. 276, no. 101a; Borelli Group�LCS, pp. 615 ff., nos., 

206-9, 214, 224-8 and Suppl. Ill, pp. 281 ff., nos. 212 b and ^225 d and e, 228a; Etna Group�LCS, 

pp.629ff, nos. 287, 301, 320, 351 and Suppl. Ill, pp.287ff, nos. 287a, 291a, 322a, 369/; and, in 

particular, in the Lipari Group�LCS, pp.655ff, nos. 447^51, 460-3, 477, 484-5 and Suppl. Ill, 

pp. 301 ff, nos. 450 a-d, 451 a-c, 461 a, 477 a-c, 514-5. 

The Spinazzo pyxis (no. 625) has several Apulian elements in it�the hollow 

rocks on which the woman on the obverse is seated, the open box held by the youth, 

and, above all, the Eros on the reverse with his very Apulian-looking wreath and fan, 

as well as the flowering plant growing beside him. He finds many parallels on vases 

by the Patera and Ganymede Painters or in the Menzies Group, especially in the 

treatment of the anatomy and the head, and in the wearing of a beaded bandolier; 

the drawing, however, is of a rather different calibre. We see here again the white 

outlined palmette-scrolls and the white-tipped leaves.

PAdd, no. A 343. 
(a) Draped woman, holding mirror and wreath, seated to 1. on rock-pile, looking back to 
r., [b) draped woman with mirror and bunch of grapes, moving to 1. 
Found with a lekanis (5459) representing a female head (no. 2/872 above) in a style 
approaching that of the Painter ofNaples 2585. 

The first lekanis (no. 626) comes from the same tomb as the bottle 5368 (no. 

623) and was found together with two other vases, both decorated with network 

patterns. The scene, which runs right round the lid, is connected in style with that on 

the obverse of the preceding vase and has similar Apulian elements, like the hollow 

rocks with black centres, or the flower springing from the ground; the rosettes in the 

field are similar to those on no. 621. The open box held by one of the seated women is 

of rather more elaborate design than that on no. 625, but is repeated on several vases 

in the Spinazzo Group (e.g. nos. 641-3); they regularly figure in toilet scenes. Here 

we have a nude woman kneeling in front of a foot-bath, the legs of which were in 

added white and are now barely visible (cf. the Port Sunlight lekanis), while a 

Paniskos, enveloped in a short cloak, looks on. The presence of the kalathos, the cista 

and Eros all suggest that the scene is connected with bridal preparations. 

The lid of the second lekanis (no. 627) is decorated with the single figure of a 

woman on each side; beside her, on both, is a very characteristic Apulian campanula 

flower with a bud above it. Close parallels to this will be found on many of the 

smaller vases from the workshop of the Darius Painter (e.g. RVAp II, p. 637, no. 

21/237 in the B.M. Centaur Group), and it is, therefore, likely that the painter of this 

vase was originally associated with it. The looped wreath, decorated with black dots, 

is also more in the Apulian tradition than Paestan, as also is the bunch of grapes 

divided into two halves�one in r.f. with black dots, the other in added white (cf. 

nos. 631, 634 below). However, we may note that the exposed flesh of the standing 

woman is painted white, which is not a regular Apulian custom for vases like this but 

provides a connecting link with those in the Group of Paestum 5188, as well as with 

some of those in the Ivy-leaf Group of Apulianising Campanian. 

On boxes and cistae of this type, which are extremely common in Apulian, see, in particular, 

Elfriede Briimmer, 'Griechische Truhenbehalter, in Jdl 100, 1985, pp. 1-168, where the main varieties 

are discussed and illustrated. 

Bell-krater 

*628 Philadelphia L. 29-46. Ht. 38-2, diam. 33-5. PLATE224a,* 
PPSupp, no. 499, pi. 16 d; LIMC III, p. 894, Eros 510a, pi. 637, 7. 
(a) Draped woman with ball in r. hand, dish of cakes and fillet in 1., moving to 1. and 
looking back to r., [b) Eros flying to 1., with fan in r. hand; below to 1., speckled bird. 

This was the first of the Apulianising Paestan vases to be recognised (PPSupp, 

p. 40) and in 1952 it stood almost alone. At the time it was pointed out that, but for 

the colour of the fired clay, the use of Paestan framing palmettes, and the presence of 

the very Paestan-looking bird on the reverse, the vase might well have been Apulian. 

The stylistic connection with the work of the Painter of Naples 2585 was noted, as 

well as such strongly Apulian elements as the hanging bunches of grapes and the 

flower springing from the ground below the figure of Eros. More vases had been 

found to associate with it in PP-s and PAdd, and it now takes its place in the 

Apulianising Group along with the other vases in this section, especially no. 627, on 

which the women are close to the one on the obverse of the bell-krater, with a similar 

treatment of the head and the drapery, through which the left leg is clearly visible. 

The Philadelphia krater, however, is of particular interest as showing a greater 

degree of paestanisation than on most of the other vases in this group, as the framing 

palmettes and the bird indicate. 

Perhaps here we might look at two other vases which look to be Paestan under 

strong Apulian influence; the former was inaccessible in 1985 and could not 

therefore be checked.

The Jason krater presents us with a number of problems; it was found in 

Paestum, but in shape and appearance it looks more Apulian. The volute-krater is a 

popular shape in later Apulian; it is exceedingly rare at Paestum, only one example 

other than the two listed above being so far known, no. 2/149 above, probably by 

Asteas, and depicting the Judgment of Paris. The saga of the Argonauts is well 

represented in Greek vase-painting, but there are comparatively few versions of the 

episode of the Golden Fleece in South Italian.

In the centre of the Naples krater is the golden fleece hanging from a branch of 

a tree round which is coiled a serpent. On the left is Medea feeding the serpent from 

a phiale, and on the right is Jason, stepping up rather gingerly to take the fleece and 

On the Argonauts in general see LIMC II, s.v. Argonautai, pp. 591 ff, with bibliography on 

p. 593; a list of the representations of the Golden Fleece is given in Brommer, VD, p. 491; the principal 

South Italian vases with this subject are the Apulian volute-kraters Munich 3268 by the Sisyphus 

Painter [RVAp I, p. 16, no. 1/51) and Leningrad 1718 ( = St. 422; RVAp I, p. 424, no. 16/55), the bell-

krater in Turin = RVAP I, p. 133, no, 5/294, pi. 43, 3; the Lucanian hydria Louvre S 4042 by the 

Brooklyn-Budapest Painter [LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 70, no. BB 38; LCS, p. 112, no. 579); and the Paestan

holding a short sword ready in his right hand just in case of accident. On each side of 

the central group stands an Argonaut, one armed with a stone, the other with a long 

spear. Above the tree is the bust of a satyr, and to the left one of Eros. The clumsy 

little scene on the neck is just the sort of thing that appears on the minor vases of this 

period, where a running woman in similar drapery to the one here is a common 

design. The reverse design is particularly crude, and the drawing a good deal less 

careful than that of the obverse; the two busts in the upper register conform to the 

typical Paestan practice. 

The shoulder of the obverse is decorated with four oval 'cushion-like objects' of 

a kind which appear especially on Campanian and Sicilian vases, but not on 

Apulian, and their presence would favour a western origin for the vase, which in 

style has affinities with the Painters ofNaples 1778 and of 2585, though it is perhaps 

closer to the latter, especially in the rendering of the Argonaut on the right and in 

the palmette scroll. There also appears to be a connection between it and the cup in 

Hamburg (no. 565), as may be seen from a comparison between the heads of the two 

bearded figures. The vase, however, still stands somewhat apart from the others in 

the Apulianising Group. See Addenda, pp. 449-451. 

On the reverse of the lid of the lekanis Paestum 5460 (no. 627 above), the visib

of the woman was painted white, and this practice is characteristic of the vases in the 

present group, which should also be compared with some of those in the Campanian 

Ivy-leaf Group (e.g. LCS, p. 498, nos. 414, 419-21; see also Suppl. Ill, pp. 234-5), 

where the same practice is followed. The drawing of the running women is 

remarkably alike, and the two groups of painters must have had a common 

background; the possibility cannot be excluded that they are in fact the same, 

working first in Campania and later at Paestum, as seems to have possibly been the 

case with the Caivano Painter. As the vases in division (i) come from Paestum or the 

neighbouring area, it seems reasonable to think of them as of local manufacture 

rather than imports from Campania. 

(i) 

The three amphorae in this division go very closely together and all have similar 

subjects. The Apulian influence is clear in the drapery of the women, the youths on 

the reverses of nos. 632-3, and the bi-colour bunch of grapes on no. 631, but the 

shape would be completely foreign to that fabric. The three are all much alike, with 

a tall neck, decorated with a fan-palmette, a long oval body, tapering downwards to 

a fairly high stem, decorated in the centre with a reserved stripe and with a foot in 

two dimensions, rather flatter on no. 631 than on 632. The palmettes on either side of 

the pictures are more after the Paestan fashion than the Apulian; those on no. 631 

have white outlines and white dots on the leaves. The women wear long chitons, the 

right breast is large and rounded, the left in profile; the fold-lines are flowing, and 

the outline of the leg clearly visible.

affinities between these objects and the 'traveller's pack' which figures on many S. Italian vases (cf. his 

pi. 48,2). They have something of the look of decorated Easter eggs, and those on Naples 3248 resemble 

the shields carried by the phlyax warriors on Moscow 735 (no. 3/3).

In LCS, Suppl. Ill, p. 237, reference was made to two vases then on the Bern market, 

which looked comparable to those of the Ivy-leaf Group, especially Naples 1993. 

They were said to have come from the same tomb as the bottle no. 636 below, and I 

should now incline to place all of them in the present group, since the connection 

between the draped woman on Paestum 5188 and those on the three Bern vases in 

particularly close. The drawing of the face and the hair, the rendering of the 

drapery, with the white stripe down the side, the treatment of the palmettes with 

white outlines and dots on the leaves, and the bunches of grapes on nos. 631 and 634 

are so alike that it seems impossible to keep these vases apart. The Apulian 

background is very evident in the 'xylophone' on no. 635, the flower on no. 634; the 

ivy-leaf on no. 635 links it with the Ivy-leaf Group, but they now seem to me better 

placed here. The seated woman on the bottle is close to the one on no. 638.

The Spinazzo Group is named after the necropolis in which in 1972 several of the

more important vases in it were found (see ArchReps 1972-3, p. 35), mostly in Tombs 

76 and 86. It includes a number of very remarkable lekanides and skyphoid pyxides 

many of which show women beside a laver or scenes associated with bridal 

preparations. A comparison between nos. 641-2 and the lekanis Paestum 24604 (no. 

452) by the Painter ofNaples 2585 will show the close connection between them and 

illustrate the influence of the Apulianising painters upon the latter. The drawing of 

the nude women by the foot-bath on no. 452 shows it clearly to be by the hand of the 

Painter ofNaples 2585 and distinguishes them from the two pairs on nos. 641-2; the 

resemblances, however, are very striking, especially in the rendering of the legs and 

knees and the placing on no. 642 of the woman's right hand over her breast, which 

finds an exact parallel on no. 452, and they point to these Apulianising lekanides as 

the probable source of inspiration for its subject. It almost looks as if the Painter of 

Naples 2585 was trying to show the Apulians that he could beat them at their own 

game. 

In RVAp II (p. 824) the Port Sunlight lekanis, at that time in Preston and 

known to me only from rather unsatisfactory photographs, was placed in the Group 

of the Trieste Askoi among a number of other vases broadly connected with the work 

of the Patera and Ganymede Painters. Thanks to excellent new photographs, kindly 

made available to me by Martin Robertson, who is preparing a catalogue of the 

vases in Port Sunlight, it now takes its proper place in the Spinazzo Group, since it is 

clearly by the same artist, whom we may call the Spinazzo Painter, as Paestum 

27027 and 27091, both from that necropolis. The three lekanides form a very 

compact group�all have a toilet scene of some kind on one side of the lid and a 

seated Eros on the other, and all are of similar large dimensions. The Port Sunlight 

lekanis (no. 641) shows two nude women, kneeling beside a foot-bath supported by 

three legs, with a similar scene on no. 643; no. 642 omits the foot-bath, and shows 

one of the women turning to take something from an open box, while the other holds 

a perfume alabastron. The open box is repeated in almost identical form on no. 643, 

and with a slight variation on no. 641. On that vase the women's drapery is bundled 

up behind them and shown in added white; on the other two there is a piece of folded 
Fig. 9. Folded display on Apulianising vases 

drapery above the scene. It is folded in a very characteristic way (see Fig. 9) and 

recurs in the same form on a number of other vases in this group. On these lekanides 

the female figures are fleshy, the breasts rounded, with dots for the nipples, the knees 

curiously rectangular, and in their kneeling posture the thigh almost completely 

occludes the leg. The bunch of hair emerging from the sphendone at the back may 

break up into two or three 'prongs', as very commonly on late Apulian. The three 

Erotes on the other side of the lids are also treated in a very uniform fashion, with 

minor variations�e.g. two hold fans, one a phiale with ivy-leaf; two sit on rock-piles, 

one on a scroll. No. 643 looks a little later than the other two and shows a slight 

decline in the quality of the drawing, especially in the body of Eros. The pattern-

work on all three is similar�rather more elaborate and more Apulian on no. 641, 

where the fan-palmettes are superposed, and the knob is decorated with a female 

head.

The folded drapery above the two women on (a) connects the minor vases in section 4 
with those in this division. 

The head on the knob of no. 641 suggests that the following lekanis, which 

comes from the same tomb as nos. 642 and 645, is by the same painter and should be 

placed here. 

E.g. nos. 647, 649-50, 662; see PP-s, p. 163 and PAdd, p. 24. For parallels in Apulian cf. RVAp II

pis. 185,4; 203,4; 312,8; 314,2; there, however, it is generally sat upon, rather than hung up, as on 

most of the Paestan vases.

Also by this painter is another vase from the same tomb:

(a) Toilet scene�two nude women at a laver; above, Eros with fan flying to 1., (o) draped 
woman running to r., with bunch of grapes in r. hand and patera in 1. 

This, too, shows a laver scene, but here the two nude women are standing, one 

on each side of the laver, above which flies a rather plump little Eros, holding up a 

fan; on either side of it is the typical piece of folded drapery with the open box in the 

top left-hand corner above. The reverse takes us back to the running women on the 

vases in the Group of Paestum 5188�again the Apulian background is very clear, 

not only in the pose and drapery of the woman, but also in the long-haired patera 

she holds in one hand, and the black-dotted bunch of grapes in the other. 

Slightly later works, but containing the stock figures from the preceding vases, 

are the two following badly battered lebetes gamikoi:

folded drapery above, and is close in style to the preceding fragment, if not from the same 
vase. 

The two following vases, which come from the same tomb as no. 643, represent, 

like that vase, a slightly later phase in the painter's work. 

Bottle

*649 Paestum 27029, from Spinazzo (1972), T. 76. Ht. 22-5 + 14-5, int. diam. 22. PLATE229 
(a) Two nude women at a laver, with folded drapery on each side of the pedestal; above, 
Eros striding to r. with wreath in r. hand and open box in 1., [b) Eros seated to 1. on tendril, 
holding cista in r. hand. 
Lid: (a) seated draped woman to 1. with mirror and bunch of grapes, [b) female head in 
profile to 1. in floral setting. 

The skyphoid pyxis is a vase of some stylistic interest and, unlike some of the 

others, especially those in (ii), is comparatively well preserved. The scene on the 

obverse is adapted from that on the lebes gamikos 27092 (no. 645) and shows the 

drapery beside the pedestal. The Eros now moves to right instead of left, and holds a 

wreath and an open box like the one on 27092. The reverse looks back to those of the 

lekanides nos. 641-3 and is a slightly more mature version of the one on no. 642, with 

hair after the fashion of no. 643 and very similar wings and hands. The lid, which has 

a large and heavy hollow knob, is decorated on the one side with a seated woman 

and on the other with a female head, springing from a flower, in a floral setting 

which looks particularly Apulian. Her flesh was originally painted white, but this 

has now worn off, leaving her somewhat featureless, like her counterpart on no. 638, 

but the treatment of the sphendone and the back hair corresponds with that of the 

head on the knob of no. 641. 

The subject of the obverses of nos. 645 and 649 is repeated, in a somewhat 

simplified form, on the following skyphoid pyxis, but the drawing has deteriorated 

sadly in quality and the vase looks like the work of an inferior imitator. A piece of the 

characteristic folded drapery hangs above the laver scene on either side, but the 

figure of Eros has been omitted, and in its place is a large white bird, perhaps 

intended for a swan. The woman to left bends forward over her left foot which rests 

on a rock-pile like that on no. 643; the treatment of the hair corresponds with that on 

the same vase and no. 649. On the reverse is a very ugly standing woman, a mirror in 

one hand and a cista in the other, with a huge bunch of grapes beneath it; she strides 

to right but turns her head back to left. There are few fold-lines on the drapery, 

which is very carelessly drawn.

The Death of Semele is a very rare subject in vase-painting; in Attic the best 

example is on the hydria in Berkeley (8/3316; CVA, Univ. of Calif, pis. 47-50), the 

namepiece of the Semele Painter (ARV, p. 1143, no. 1), and in Apulian on the 

volute-krater by the Arpi Painter (RVAp II, p. 926, no. 28/96; later London market, 

Sotheby, Sale Cat. 13-14 Dec. 1983, no. 407, ill. on p. 127 and 16 July 1986, no. 174, 

ill. on p. 80; now in a private collection in Tampa, Florida). Added white, which has 

now largely worn off, was used for exposed female flesh, and a very bright red for the 

drapery below the body of Semele.

Another fragment, bearing the same number as the above, shows part of a 

woman with white flesh seated upon a couch; to left is the leg of a youth. It does not 

seem to belong to the above, although it is close to it in style, and is also comparable 

to the Semele fragment (no. 651).

seems to be more in the Apulianising manner. 

(iv) The Frontal Face Group 

Skyphoid pyxis 

*662 Paestum 26713, from Spinazzo (1972), T. 4. Ht. 43-5 (= 27 + 16-5). PLATE232 
ArchReps 1972-3, p. 30. fig. 6; Greco Pontrandolfo, Dial, di Arch 1979/2, p. 45, fig. 24 
(illustrating the whole tomb group). 
(a) Woman, with small white bird on lap, seated to 1. facing draped woman bending 
forward with egg in r. hand and wreath in 1., to r. nude youth with drapery over 1. arm resting 
his hand on the shoulder of the seated woman, satyr-boy, [b) two draped youths with an Ionic 
pillar between them, on top of which is a cup. 
Below the handles: large frontal female heads. 
Lid: (a) two nude women kneeling, with folded drapery top 1. and bottom r., one to 1. 
holding white alabastron, the one to r. opening a box, [b) Eros with fillet and fan flying to r., 
with head turned to 1. Between the two scenes large frontal female heads, like those below the 
handles. 

This is perhaps the most remarkable of all the Apulianising vases found in the 

1972 excavations at the Spinazzo necropolis of Paestum. It comes from Tomb 4 and 

technique, a net-pattern bottle, and some lekanides with simple decoration in added 

colour on the lids. The context would therefore suggest a date around the end of the 

fourth century B.C. The scene on the obverse of the bowl follows on from others in the 

Spinazzo Group, but a new element is added on the reverse by the appearance of 

two draped youths, one on each side of an Ionic column, and by the presence of large 

full-faced female heads beneath the handles and between the two scenes on the lid. 

Good Apulian prototypes for both will be found on vases by followers of the 

Baltimore Painter, especially the Painter of Berlin F 3383 and the Virginia 

Exhibition Painter (RVAp II, pp. 917 ff.; Suppl. I, pp. 170-4); on many of their vases 

(e.g. nos. 28/62^-, 86 a-b) we find two somewhat similar youths and indeed on one 

by a later follower in the Foggia Group (Suppl. I, p. 201, no. 30/15 a) they stand 

beside an Ionic column not unlike the one on our vase. The frontal heads also find 

good parallels on some of the vases associated with these painters (RVAp II, 

pp. 953-4) and, in particular, in the heads on a dish now in the Geddes collection in 

Melbourne (A 2:7; ex Sotheby, Sale Cat. 21 May 1984, no. 219, ill. on p. 41), and on 

the oenochoe Taranto 61501 (RVAp II, no. 28/356, pi. 373, 6); cf. also the head on 

the Scylla askos Mannheim Cg 230, by the Mignot Printer (RVAp II, p. 1025, no. 

30/45, pi. 397, 1). The lebes gamikos Vienna 4012 (R VAp II, no. 28/70, pi. 355, 5-6), 

by the Painter of Berlin F 3383, has on its obverse a laver scene comparable to some 

of those on the vases of the Spinazzo Group. The stylistic connections are so clear 

that the painter of Paestum 26713 must, at least, have been familiar with the work of 

the followers of the Baltimore Painter referred to above, 

On the other hand, the scenes on the lid bring us back at once to the other vases 

of the Spinazzo Group; on the obverse are two nude women, crouching down, one 

clutching an alabastron, the other raising the lid of a box, with a piece of folded 

drapery on either side, one above and one below; on the reverse an Eros flying to 

right, with a fan in one hand. Between the two scenes are huge frontal female faces, 

with staring eyes highlighted in white, full rounded cheeks, clearly indicated nostrils, 

and a slit mouth with thick lower lip. They are less well drawn than those below the 

handles, but in the same vein. On the left side of the vase, on the reserved space just 

above the handle, and overlapping on to the lid a large M has been incised to 

indicate precisely where the lid should be placed. 

A somewhat similar female head, with large staring eyes, appears on the reverse 

of a fragmentary bottle from the Foce del Sele, but it is not by the same hand nor of 

the same quality as the pyxis.

This section lists a number of smaller vases, especially bottles, mostly from th

the Heraion, where they had apparently been offered as a dedication to the goddess. 

Most of them depict women or Erotes, as on the larger vases, and there is often a 

piece of folded drapery (as on Fig. 9) in the background, as on Paestum 27027, 

27029, 27091 (nos. 643, 649, 642).

(i) 

We have already noted the presence on a few of the vases in sections 1 to 3 above of 

female heads as subsidiary decoration on the lids of skyphoid pyxides or the knobs of 

lekanides. With the exception of the somewhat later frontal heads on nos. 662-3, 

which seem to reflect the influence of the followers of the Baltimore Painter, as might 

be expected on vases dating to the end of the fourth century, the others are all in 

profile, as indeed are the majority of female heads on Apulian vases. The earlier 

Apulianising heads seem to reflect the influence of painters in the Darius-

Underworld workshop (e.g. Zurich 2660, Winterthur Group, Monopoli Group�cf. 

RVAp, pis. 252, 258-9, 262-3), the later seem nearer to those from the workshop of 

the Baltimore Painter and his followers (cf. pis. 371-3), but there is nothing that 

corresponds with the latest heads of the Kantharos Group. 

As we have seen, the Apulianising school had considerable influence upon the 

Painter ofNaples 2585, and thus it is not always easy to distinguish his female heads 

from those belonging to the former group; this is very clear on such a vase as Paestum 

24605 (no. 472), which, while found in a context very closely associated with the 

Painter ofNaples 2585, is none the less strongly Apulianising in its rendering of the 

female head. The same is true of the heads on the following vases, which, like that on 

24605, illustrate the close connection between the two, though on balance they seem 

closer to Apulianising.

[a) and [b) Female head. 

These two come from the same tomb and have very similar pattern-work�the 

ring of black blobs on the knob, the band of thick strokes round the rim, the white 

stroke down the upper portion of the central leaf in the palmette-fans (cf. with the 

Painter ofNaples 2585). Both heads wear large spiky stephanai, again very much in 

that painter's manner. They seem, however, to stand a little apart from the regular 

run of his heads, and the presence of a comb-palmette on no. 685 strengthens the 

case for regarding them as nearer to the work of the Apulianising Group. A 

somewhat similar head, with a large stephane as on no. 686, appears on the 

following: 

Squat lekythos 

*687 Paestum, from C. Arcioni (1977), T. 116. Ht. 20. PLATE233/ 
Female head in profile to 1. 

The head is framed between scrolls outlined on the inside in white, with drop 

leaves decorated with a white dot. In general treatment the head is not far from 

those on nos. 685-6; the pupil of the eye is small, as on no. 685, the lower lip is closer 

to that on no. 686. 

Perhaps best placed in this context is: 

Lekanis

Found with a lebes gamikos (21629; no. 26) by the Painter ofNaples 1778 and an 
oenochoe (21625; no. 416) by the Painter ofNaples 2585. 
It is closer to the work of the Painter ofNaples 1778 than the other three vases. 

On the heads on the lid of no. 656 and in the tondo of no. 657, which go closely 

together, the two lines marking the upper eyelid meet at a sharply acute angle just 

above the pupil, and the same phenomenon may be observed on some other heads, 

which are similar also in their treatment of the kekryphalos, decorated with strokes, 

black dots and curving lines, and of the bunch of hair emerging from it at the back.

Bell-kraters 

The two following bell-kraters are very badly battered; little more than the central 

part of the bowl remains of no. 692, part of the bowl and the stem of no. 693. The 

heads, as far as one can judge from what remains of them, look close in style to those 

on nos. 689-91.

A slightly later version of this head, in which the mouth appears as a concave 

line, but the eye and hair are treated as on nos. 689-691, appears on the following:

With the above heads should be compared those on the following:

PAdd, no. A 358. 
The lid is in two sections�a lekanis-type lid decorated with (a) female head in kekryphalos

female heads like that on [b).

PAdd, no. A 373. 
(a) and [b) Female head. 

A rather different treatment of the eye will be found on the head on the 

following vase; here the eyebrow and upper lid are shown as three distinct strokes, 

the pupil is large, and the lower lid a shorter line below it, which does not meet the 

upper. The kekryphalos is much as on no. 687, but there is a row of curls above the 

hair across the brow, and on the hair projecting at the back. The obverse is 

decorated with a kneeling woman, whose head is turned in three-quarter view to 

right; her drapery is very scrappily drawn, and a red cloak flaps out behind her back. 

The vase comes from the Spinazzo necropolis, but the figure on the obverse finds no 

close parallel on any of the other vases from that site.

(a) Kneeling draped woman, [b) female head to 1. 

Lastly in this division we may look at a vase of a shape unique at Paestum. 

Lekythos of the Talcott class 

*700 Paestum 27004, from Spinazzo (1972), T. 75. Ht. 13-5. PLATE235a 
Female head to 1. 

The Talcott class is discussed by Brian Sparkes in an article in AntK 20, 1977, 

pp. 8-25; he describes such vases as 'of pear-shaped body, narrow neck, broad 

mouth, and vertical handle from mouth to shoulder. The majority of pieces have a 

low foot'. This is the only South Italian r.f. example of this shape known to me; 

Sparkes has listed more than thirty vases of this shape either in plain black glaze or 

with a Gnathia type of decoration, but none of them corresponds very closely in 

shape to this one, which for the time being stands as an isolated phenomenon. 

Several of the examples cited by Sparkes would appear to be dated late in the fourth 

century, which would be quite appropriate for the Paestan vase, as also the fact that 

other South Italian pieces come from either Apulia or Sicily. The head seems to 

belong to the Apulianising Group� the eye, nostril, and mouth are close to those on 

the head on no. 699, and the touch of white beside the pupil appears also on no. 660. 

(ii) With 'melon-slice' hair 

A few of the later Apulianising vases show female heads with hair in the so-called 

'melon-slice' style, in which it appears as a series of strands pulled taut from the 

forehead to the bunch of hair at the back, a fashion which is found in sculpture from 

the later fifth century B.C. but achieves its greatest popularity in the second half of 

the fourth century and later. The bottle from the Paestan Heraion (no. 701) gives an 

excellent example of this fashion, which appears both on the small head on the 

shoulder of the obverse and on the larger head on the reverse, where it is flanked by 

spiralling scrolls and palmettes. In a rather cruder form it will also be found on the 

lid of the Madrid skyphoid pyxis (no. 703) and on several small fragments from the 

agora at Paestum.

The Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age, p. 44; A. W. Lawrence, Greek and Roman Sculpture, p. 55. It appears in an

early form on the relief from the Altar of the Twelve Gods in the Athenian Agora, representing Medea 

and the daughters of Pelias (Richter, Sculptures, fig. 324; Gotze, RM 53, 1938, pp. 200 ff., pi. 38), dating 

to the last quarter of the fifth century (Thompson and Wycherley, The Athenian Agora XIV, p. 134); the 

so-called Corinna, associated with the sculptor Silanion who was active c. 330 B.C., gives an excellent 

illustration of this fashion of hair-dressing (see Bieber, op. cit., figs. 120-2, with a reproduction on fig. 

123 of a Greek coin of Orthagoria showing a head of Artemis with a similar hair-do; Picard, op. cit., 

figs. 364�9; Richter, Portraits of the Greeks, p. 144, figs. 780-2), which frequently appears on the 

terracotta figurines from Tanagra and Taranto of the later fourth and third centuries B.C. On the latter 

see F. van der Wielen van Ommeren in OM Leiden 63, 1982, pp. 100-1, nos. P21 and 22 and p. 127, figs. 

42-3. Note 154 on p. 100 lists a number of other Tarentine examples. A further excellent example 

appears on a gold ring in Taranto (inv. 54117; De Juliis and Loiacono, Taranto. II Museo Archeologico 

(1986), p. 309, fig. 358), dating from the later fourth century, and another of slightly later date on a 

terracotta female head (inv. 52054; op. cit., p. 402, fig. 495).

fold-lines are very thick. 

(iii) 

Perhaps this is the best place in which to consider a rather unusual plate; it w

found with no accompanying r.f. vases, which might have served to give it some sort 

of context. 

Plate 

*706 Paestum 6193, from C. Andriuolo-Laghetto (1955), T. 95. Diam. 15-5. PLATE235e 
FA 10, 1955, p. 214, no. 2592, fig. 66. 
Female head to 1., with inscription CATQN painted on the neck. 

The head is a little reminiscent of those which appeared on two cups (nos. 

2/915-6 above; PI. 143 j and k), which were placed at the end of section 4 in 

Chapter IX and noted as near in style to some of the work of the Painter ofNaples 

2585. On this plate the hair, which is not caught up in any form of head-dress, 

appears as a black mass on top of the head, enlivened by a row of white beads 

immediately above the brow, a white line bordered by strokes in the centre, and a 

row of strokes at the back. There is a long lock of curly hair at the back of the head 

(cf. no. 592), and above the forehead a fringe of curls in a series of loops (cf. no. 

2/918, PI. 143 1 above). The visible ear is adorned with an ear-ring in the shape of a 

horse-shoe and there is a necklace of black beads just above the inscription. The 

eyebrow is slightly arched, the two lines of the upper lid meet at an acute angle just 

above the large round black pupil; the lower lid is short. At the base of the nostril is a 

dot; the black line indicating the mouth has mostly disappeared. There is no very 

close parallel to it on the Apulianising heads, but the general treatment suggests at 

least a degree of Apulian influence (cf. with the head on the reverse of no. 701). 

The interpretation of the inscription remains problematic. Dr. Peter Fraser 

kindly informs me that as yet this is the only occurrence of the name Zcxycov, and in 

his opinion the carefully-written letters cannot be read in any other way (e.g. as 

TAAQN). He points out the anomaly of putting what must be the name of a man on 

the head of what seems very clearly to be a woman; it is unlikely to be the name of 

the painter and at present its significance remains obscure. 
7. AN APULIANISING FISH-PLATE 

The following fish-plate comes from T. 18 of the 1955 excavations in the Contra

Andriuolo where it was found along with the squat lekythos 5656, which has been 

placed in the Early Apulianising Group (no. 622 above). The plate, which was 

placed in PAdd (p. 13, no. A 201) as near in style to the work of Asteas, differs from 

all the others found at Paestum in being much closer to Apulian, especially to the 

plates in the Phrixos Group, as may be seen from a comparison between the torpedo 

and perch upon it with those on the Schimmel dish and on other vases of that group 

(e.g. GRFP, nos. IVA/59, 60, 68) or from the prawns, which are very like those on 

nos. 73 and 83. The fired clay, however, looks more like Paestan and the single-

dotted border is perhaps an attempt to conform to the local practice. It is not easy to 

place the plate precisely since, although it appears close in style to those in the 

Phrixos Group, it does not exactly match any of the existing plates in it, and it 

therefore seems not unlikely that it is in fact of Paestan manufacture by an Apulian 

migrant, perhaps even by the painter of the squat lekythos 5656. The Phrixos Group 

comes from the workshop of the Darius Painter, which, as we have seen, influenced a 

number of the Paestan Apulianising vases.

Squat lekythos 

*710 Salerno VD 77, from Teggiano. Ht. 30. PLATE 236 e 
Dionysos, with kantharos and thyrsus, maenad coming up with situla. 

Nos. 709 and 710 are clearly the work of the same painter, since the two figures 

of Dionysos are remarkably alike, and the drapery of the two maenads is also treated 

in much the same fashion. Both vases have somewhat similar framing palmettes, 

which are clearly modelled on Paestan, and they may well be a local imitation of 

that fabric. Since the rendering of the scales of the fish closely matches the way in 

which the drapery is treated on no. 710, it is probable that the plate should also be 

ascribed to the same hand.
