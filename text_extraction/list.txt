SHAPE: Fragmentary vase from Buccino 

131 Salerno, from Buccino, T. 104. Diam. c. 30. Very fragmentary. 
Dr. Johannowsky has kindly informed me that the fragments, referred to by Marcello 
Gigante in PdP, 1984, p. 151, and originally said to come from a calyx-krater are in fact from 
a squat lekythos [StEtr 52, 1984, p. 497). The signature AZ... Al ErPACPEN is inscribed on 
the base of a column or stele. To left is a male figure in a himation, to right two women, one 
making a libation from an oenochoe; another fragment depicts part of a satyr, but its location 
cannot be determined. No further details are at present available.

p. 34, no. 54, ill. on pp. 35-6. 
The vase has the form of a lekanis, with figured decoration around the lid and a frontal 
white female head on the knob. Internally it is divided into four compartments, around a 
central well, and each compartment is fitted with a lid decorated in red-figure, with two small 
perforated holes at the top. A comparable r.f. vase is B.M. F 139 [CVA 2, IV Ea, pi. 4,11; LCS, 
p. 211, no. 64 and Suppl. Ill, p. 105, no. 105, where it is attributed to the Revel Painter), and 
another, in the Gnathia technique, is B.M. F 502 [CVA 1, IV Dc, pi. 8,15-16), although the 
former lacks a covering lid, and the latter individual lids to the four compartments. An earlier 
example of a Paestan vase divided internally into compartments, each with a figured lid, will 
be found in the remarkable hydria at present on the London market (no. 2/85; PI. 37); a 
somewhat later lepaste (no. 165), also in the Geddes collection, is divided internally into four 
compartments, like the present vase, which may well have served as its model, although there 
are no individual lids for the compartments. 
Lid: Young satyr in front of seated draped woman, young silen capering by nude woman 
(white flesh), approached from behind by a young silen, with a nude boy bending down 
behind him, standing draped woman, nude woman at laver beside which is a swan. 
Knob: Frontal female head, with face in added white, now largely worn off. 
Interior: (i) woman seated on dotted rock, veined palmette leaf to r.; (ii) nude youth

arms, [b) nude youth with food raised on rock, holding wreath in 1. hand, phiale and fillet in r. 
Neck: (a) female head, [b) palmette. 
In PP, and PPSupp, this vase was attributed to the Painter of Naples 2585, but the 
drawing of the woman's face, the rendering of her drapery, and the head on the neck all 
suggest that it would be better placed here. The figure on the reverse is much repainted, but it 
also looks nearer to this painter than to his colleague.

(a) Female head with white flesh, [b) r.f. female head. 
In PAdd (p. 16) this vase was placed in the Group ofNaples 1778, but the use of white for 
the face of the head on the obverse, and the stylistic connection between the r.f. head on the 
reverse and that on no. 550 above suggest it is better placed here.

In PP this vase was associated with the Painter of Naples 2585 and in PPSupp it was 
placed among the later minor vases of the Asteas-Python workshop; it now seems to me nearer 
to the former and the presence of certain Apulianising elements in the treatment of the 
drapery and flower tend to confirm this.
